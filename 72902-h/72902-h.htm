</div>


<p>This book is primarily intended for non-technical
readers; and for the student aviators who, called from
non-technical occupations, must cram themselves at short
notice with the gist of airplane flying; and who must omit
everything except the outstanding fundamentals.</p>

<p>The desired essentials are here given without sacrificing
accuracy to brevity. It has been necessary to omit
many technical details of interest to the aeronautical
engineer, to whose needs other larger textbooks are
adapted as a complete survey of technical aeronautics.
In brief, the book presents the main principles of aviation,
such as the aviator must know in order properly to understand
his airplane, keep it trued up, and operate it in
cross-country flights as well as at the flying field.</p>

<p>Out of the 2000 aeronautical books now in existence,
a few are adapted to use as textbooks for the present
need, but none give the particular and abridged information
in tabloid form such as must be adopted for the best
time economy of these students.</p>

<p>It is by the kind permission of Professor E. A. Holbrook,
Mr. O. S. Beyer, and Mr. C. M. Hebbert that
chapters VI to XI have been included. Acknowledgment
and full credit is due them as co-authors. Chap.
VI, VII, and part of Chap. XI were prepared by Prof.
E. A. Holbrook; Chap. IX, X, pages 152-157 of Chap.
VIII, and pages 173-177 of Chap. XI were prepared by
Mr. O. S. Beyer; Chap. VIII, pages 133-152, was prepared
by Mr. C. M. Hebbert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span></p>

<p>In the Chapter on “History of Aviation” only those
experiments are treated which have a bearing on flight
today; this chapter is to be used in conjunction with the
Chapter on “Principles of Flight,” especially as regards
controlling the airplane.</p>

<p>The question of Airplane Motors has not been touched,
because to do it justice would unduly increase the size
of this volume, and because adequate treatises on the
subject are available.</p>

<span class="bold">HISTORY OF AVIATION</span></h2>


<p>That part of the history of Aviation which has
especial interest for aviators is of recent date, and
extends back only two dozen years. Of course
efforts have been made toward manflight ever since
the early sixteenth century, when Leonardo da
Vinci invented the parachute and became the first
patron of aeronautics; between the time of this
famous artist and the present many experimenters
have given their attention to the problem, but
previous to the last decade of the nineteenth century
nothing practical was achieved. Then, with
the perfection of the steam engine and the development
of the gasoline engine, there came inducement
to sound experimentation, bringing forth such well-known
figures as Maxim, Langley, Lillienthal and
Chanute.</p>

<p>The work of each of these men is an interesting
story by itself, especially that of Langley, who
approached the matter from a strictly scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
viewpoint, established testing apparatus and built
successful self-propelled steam models years before
the Wright brothers reported their independent
successes. He reproduced his models to full scale
with every expectation of success, but failed, due
to exhaustion of his capital.</p>

<p><b>Langley’s Experiments in Aerial Navigation.</b>—In
all the history of aerial navigation one of the
most romantic stories is that describing the scientific
researches begun in 1887 by Langley and culminating
in 1896 in the first really successful case of
mechanical flight using a prime mover; continuing
up to 1903 when this first successful machine, a
model of 12-ft. span, was reproduced to full scale
and manned for its trial flight by a human pilot; and
ending with the destruction of this full-sized machine
on launching, so that Langley missed the
glory of being the actual discoverer of manflight
only by a hair’s breadth, dying shortly afterward of
a broken heart, as is conceded by those who knew
him. If this full-scale machine had performed as
successfully in 1903 as it actually did after being
rebuilt and partly remodelled a decade later by
the Curtiss company, Langley would have antedated
the first successful flight made by the Wright
brothers by a narrow margin of about 2 months.</p>

<br>

<p>Lillienthal was the first man to accomplish successful
flights through the air by the use of artificial wing surfaces. After many years of experiment
and study of soaring birds he constructed rigid
wings which he held to his shoulders and which,
after he had gained considerable velocity by running
forward downhill, would catch the air and lift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
his weight completely off the ground. The wings
were arched, for he observed this was the case in
all birds; flat wings proved useless in flight, and
suggested a reason for the failure of previous experimenters.
To these rigid wings Lillienthal fastened
a rigid tail; the wings and the tail comprised his
“glider.” There were no control levers and the
only way the operator could steer was to shift the
balance by swinging his legs one way or the other.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
Lillienthal constructed an artificial hill for his gliding
so that he could coast downward for some distance
without striking the ground and he was able
to accomplish many glides of a couple of hundred
yards in length.</p>

<p><b>Chanute (Chicago, 1896).</b>—Chanute’s experiments
in gliding were quite similar to Lillienthal’s
and were made on the sand dunes along Lake Michigan
outside of Chicago. His apparatus was more
strongly constructed, being of trussed biplane type,
a construction suggested to him by his experience
in bridge building, and one which persists today as
the basis of strength in our present military
biplanes.</p>

<p><b>The Wright Brothers, 1901.</b>—Lillienthal was
killed in a glide, having lost control of his apparatus
while some distance above the ground. The Wright
brothers read of his death and commenced thinking
over the whole problem. Lillienthal’s method of
balancing his large apparatus by the mere effect
of swinging his legs appeared to them as a very
inadequate means of control. They came to the
conclusion that the immediate problem in artificial
flight was the problem of stability, which they
felt should be solved by an entirely different
means than that employed by Lillienthal and
Chanute. The work already done had demonstrated
without question that support in the air
had been established; with the addition of controllability
the Wrights looked forward to doing something
worth while in the way of artificial flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>To improve Lillienthal’s method of shifting the
weight, they conceived the idea of leaving the pilot
in an immovable position in the glider, and instead
of obliging him to shift his weight this way and that,
they proposed to manipulate the surfaces of the
wings themselves by means of levers under the
pilot’s control, so that the same result of balancing
could be obtained by quite a different and superior
method.</p>

<p>They set out, therefore, deliberately to solve the
whole question of airplane stability. There was
the fore and aft or horizontal stability, for which
Lillienthal had swung his legs forward and backward;
there was in addition the sidewise or lateral
stability for which Lillienthal had swung his legs
to left and right. The fundamental requirements
to be met were that during flight the glider should
be kept in its proper attitude without diving or
rearing up, and without rolling into an attitude
where one wing tip was higher than the other, i.e.,
the machine was to be kept level in both directions.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Fore and Aft Control.</b>—After some preliminary
trials the Wrights found that the fore and aft
balance could be controlled by an elevator or horizontal
rudder, supported on outriggers on the front
of the airplane, and operated by a lever. If the
pilot found the glider pitching too much downward,
and tending toward a dive, he would tilt the
elevator upward by moving the lever, thus turning
the glider back into its proper attitude. This
elevator in modern machines is back of the airplane,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>a better place for it than was chosen by the Wrights.
It may be said that their chief reason for first putting
it in front was that they could see it there and
observe its effect. They soon realized that the
rear location gave easier control, and they acted
accordingly.</p>

<p><b>Lateral Control.</b>—After satisfying themselves regarding
fore and aft control, the Wrights took up
lateral control. Their problem was to devise a
means for keeping the span of the wings level so
that when for any reason one wing tip should
sink lower than the other, it could be at once raised
back to its proper position. Lillienthal had tried
to do this by swinging his legs toward the high side;
the shifted weight restoring the position. The
Wrights, to obviate this inadequate method, bethought
themselves to restore equilibrium by means
of the wind itself rather than by gravity. They
observed an interesting maneuver employed by a
pigeon which seemed to secure its lateral balance
in exactly the way they wanted; this bird was seen
to give its two wings each a different angle of attack,
whereat one wing would lift more forcibly than the
other, thereby rotating the bird bodily in any
desired amount or direction about the line of flight
as an axis. To copy this bird apparatus in a Wright
glider, it was found sufficient to alter the angle of
the wing tips only, leaving the chief part of the
supporting surface in its original rigid position.
In other words, the wing tips were to be warped;
the one to present greater angle of attack, the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
less angle, exactly as in the case of the pigeon.
Suppose the airplane to develop a list to the left,
the wing on that side sinking, the pilot was to increase
the angle at the tip of this left-hand wing by
moving the warping lever, and at the same time
decrease the angle of the right-hand wing by the
same lever. He was to hold this position until the
airplane was righted and brought back to level
position.</p>

<p>This arrangement proved to have the effect
anticipated and maintained stability easily on a
glider much larger than Lillienthal ever managed
with his leg-swinging method.</p>

<p><b>Directional Control.</b>—We have now followed the
development by the Wrights of airplane control
as regards:</p>

<p>1. Fore and aft or “pitching” motion, accomplished
by an elevator operated by lever.</p>

<p>2. Lateral or “rolling” motion accomplished by
wing warping operated by a second lever.</p>

<p>These were the only controls used in the earliest
gliders. It remains to consider the third element
of control, viz:</p>

<p>3. The directional or “yawing” control, which is
accomplished by an ordinary vertical rudder operated
by a third lever.</p>

<p>The Wrights found the warping had all the effect
anticipated but had also certain secondary and
undesirable effects. Whenever they applied the
warping lever to correct the rolling motion, the
glider responded as far as rolling control was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
concerned, but at the same time would “yaw” or
swerve out of its course to right or left. This was
a serious complication. For, in the moment of
swerving, the high wing which they desired to
depress would advance faster than the low wing, and
solely by its higher velocity tended to develop a
greater lift and thereby neutralize the beneficial
effect of the warp. In many of their early glides,
because of pronounced swerving, the warp effect
was entirely counteracted and failed to bring the
glider back to level; with the result that one wing
tip would sink, at the same time swinging backward
until the machine was brought to the ground.
No amount of controlling could prevent this.</p>

<p>After much bewilderment on this point, the
Wrights observed that whenever a wing tip was
warped to a large angle its resistance became
relatively greater and it slowed up while the opposite
side went ahead. They at once hit upon the
idea of a rudder, previously considered unnecessary,
which they believed could be turned in each case
of yawing just enough to create a new and apposing
yawing force of equal magnitude.</p>

<p>They therefore attached a rudder at the rear,
connecting its tiller ropes to lever No. 2, and giving
this lever a compound motion so that one hand could
operate either warp or rudder control independently
(or simultaneously in proper proportion to eliminate
the yawing tendency above mentioned). This
combination is the basis of the Wright patents and
is essential in airplanes of today.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>Great success now ensued in their gliding experiments;
the machine was always in perfect control;
could be manipulated in any desired manner; turned
to right or left, or brought down to earth with safety.</p>

<p>Thus were the three elements of control applied
by the Wrights to their glider and the problem
apparent in Lillienthal’s death was solved. The
next step was to install a power plant able to maintain
forward speed without resorting to coasting
downhill by gravity; and therefore capable of producing
a horizontal flight.</p>

<p>In developing a power flyer aside from the question
of control the proper design was arrived at as
follows:</p>

<p><b>Efficiency of Wings.</b>—The Wrights knew from
Langley and Chanute that flat wings were inefficient
and useless, and curved wings essential; they did not
know whether the amount of curvature mattered
much. To find this out by trials in gliding would
be slow and expensive. They adopted a better
way—the wind-tunnel method, wherein small-scale
models were tested and compared for efficiency
in a blast of air. They made their wind tunnel 16
in. in diameter and created a powerful air blast
through it by means of an engine-driven fan. Small
models of wings were placed in the center of this
confined air blast, mounted on a balance arm which
projected into the tunnel from the outside. The air
forces and efficiency of the models were thus measured.
A large variety of shapes were tested and
one was selected as best of all from the standpoint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
of curvature and rounded wing tips. This shape
was adopted in their flyer, and though on a much
larger scale fulfilled the predictions made for its
efficiency in the indoor wind-tunnel experiments.</p>

<p>The Wright glider was, of course, a biplane model.
They tested a small 6-in. model biplane and found
that the two wings together were less efficient than
either wing by itself. However, other considerations,
such as rigidity of trussing, decided them to
adopt the biplane rather than a monoplane
arrangement.</p>

<p><b>Low Resistance to Forward Motion.</b>—The
Wrights used their wind tunnel also in choosing for
the struts of their airplane a shape which would
present least head resistance to forward motion.
They found that a square strut had a resistance
which could be decreased by changing the shape to
resemble a fish. The resistance of the pilot himself
was decreased by making him lie prone, face
downward on the bottom wing.</p>

<p><b>Propeller Efficiency.</b>—Although little data on the
subject of propeller efficiency was available to the
Wrights, they were able to arrive at a very creditable
design wherein two propellers were used,
driven from a single motor, and rotating one each
side of the pilot. The mechanical difficulties which
have since embarrassed the use of two propellers
were less with the Wrights because they were dealing
with smaller horsepowers than are in use today;
they therefore were able to realize a very high propeller
efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p><b>Motor.</b>—When the Wrights were ready to apply
a motor to their glider, they found it impossible
to secure one light enough, and had to set about
building one themselves. They adopted a four-cylinder
type, water-cooled, and their aim was to
save weight and complication wherever possible.
Their first motor gave about 12 hp., which was
raised to a higher and higher figure by subsequent
improvements until it reached 20 hp. In its
earliest stages it was able to give sufficient power
for short horizontal flights.</p>

<p><b>Means of Starting and Landing.</b>—One reason the
Wrights could use such low horsepower was that
they employed auxiliary starting apparatus to get
up original speed. They knew that less horsepower
was necessary to fly an airplane after it was once in
the air than was necessary to get it into the air at
the start, and they therefore rigged up a catapult
which projected their airplane forward on a rolling
carriage with great force at the start, so that all the
motor had to do was to maintain the flight in air.
The Wright airplane had at first no landing wheels,
and was provided only with light skids on which it
could make a decent landing. Present-day airplanes,
of course, have wheels on which to roll both
at starting and at landing and their motors are
powerful enough to eliminate the necessity for a
starting catapult.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bleriot’s Contribution to Aviation.</b>—Bleriot experimented
a great many years before he attained
success and did so years after the Wrights had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>successfully flown. But when he did obtain success,
his great ingenuity produced features of design
which were a decided step forward. He added a
body to the airplane and produced a machine which
instead of being a pair of wings with various appendages,
was a body to which wings were attached,
giving a more shipshape and convenient arrangement.
The motor, instead of being located beside
the pilot as in the Wright machine, was put in the
very front of the body ahead of the pilot where it
was not likely to fall on him in case of a smash.
This location of the motor entailed the use of a
single propeller at the front, a “tractor” screw as it
was called, less efficient than the double propeller
of the Wrights, but better from the standpoint of
mechanical convenience. The body of a Bleriot,
which was quite similar to the body of any bird in
its general arrangement, projected to the rear in a
tapering form and carried at the rear a rudder and
elevator. The motor, pilot and tanks were thus
enclosed within the body and away from the wind.
Bleriot’s contributions were then, better location of
the motor, adaptation of the body or “fuselage,”
elimination of the front elevator and substitution of
the rear elevator.</p>

<p><b>Nieuport and Fokker’s Contribution to Aviation.</b>—A
further advance on Bleriot’s design was made
by Nieuport and later by Fokker. The former
utilized the fuselage principle of Bleriot and enclosed
the whole framework, front and back, to
give a stream-line form, and even went so far as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
make wind-tunnel experiments from which he was
able to choose a very efficient fuselage shape as well
as wing and strut efficiency.</p>

<span class="bold">TYPES OF MILITARY AIRPLANES AND THEIR
USES</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Modern Airplanes Combining Best Features of
Previous Experiments.</b>—The modern airplane, of
which the Curtiss training machine used at the
U. S. Aviation Schools is typical, is a combination
of the best features referred to above. It is of the
biplane type for, as shown by Chanute, rigid trussing
is thus possible, an advantage sufficient to offset
the slight loss of efficiency which exists in the biplane.
The landing gear consists of two wheels provided
with shock absorbers; the body is of the general
stream-line type, enclosed from front to back,
containing comfortable seats for the passengers and
enclosing the motor and tanks away from the wind.
The motor is at the front where, in an accident, it
will not be on top of the pilot. The warping effect
is obtained by hinging flaps at the wing tips, the
same effect being obtained while at the same time
leaving the whole wing structure rigid and strong
rather than flexible and weak, as was the case in
the early warping type of machines.</p>

<p><b>Military Airplanes of Today.</b>—In the modern
airplane, therefore, we see that matters of efficiency,
to which the Wrights gave great attention, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
been sacrificed in favor of convenience, particularly
in favor of power and speed. This is the effect of
military demands for airplanes where power, speed,
and ability to climb fast are vital requirements.
To escape from or to destroy an enemy, high speed
and ability to climb fast are, of course, prerequisites.
Moreover, from the standpoint of safety in maneuvering
it is desirable to have a reserve of power and
speed. Therefore, the design of military machines
has tended in a given direction up to the present.</p>

<p>New considerations have arisen on this account,
such as for instance the question of landing. Fast
machines in general make high-speed landings, and
are for that reason dangerous. The original Wright
machines were built to land at such a slow speed
that ordinary skids were sufficient to take the shocks.
Nowadays the high-powered airplane is likely to
come to grief in landing more than at any other
time. The question of stability in flight has of
recent years been treated mathematically and
experimentally, using of course the fundamental
system of “three axes control” first applied by the
Wrights. It has been found that by properly proportioning
the tail surfaces and properly arranging
the wings and center of gravity, any desired degree
of stability may be obtained, such that a machine
may be made almost self-flying or, if preferred,
may be made very sensitive.</p>

<p>All of the above features of design have had consideration
in the latest types of military airplanes.
Observe the high speed of the latest speed scouts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
where power is concentrated exclusively on speed
and climbing ability and landing speed is dangerously
high. We see the advent of the triplane scout,
which is an attempt to secure slow landing speed
combined with high flying speed. We see machines
with the motor and propeller in the rear, or with
two motors, one to each side of the body out in
the wings, the object being to avoid interference of
the propeller with the range of gun fire. In short,
we see the effect of many military considerations
on the design of the airplane. It will be interesting
at this point to survey what are these military uses
of the airplane.</p>

<p><b>Aerial Fighting.</b>—Fighting in the air is the most
spectacular use to which military airplanes have
been put. The first requirements in a fighting
airplane are speed and climbing ability and these
must be obtained at all costs, because speed and
climb are weapons of defense and offense second
only in value to the gun itself. The concentration
of motive power for speed and climb requires that
as little weight as possible be used; and therefore
the fastest fighters are designed to carry only one
person and are very light and of course very small.
It is usual to have one gun fixed to the body and
firing through the propeller in the case of a tractor,
and a second adjustable aim gun pointing upwards
over the top wing. This gives the pilot a chance to
fire a round at the enemy while “sitting on his tail”
or following from behind; and then when diving
below the enemy the second gun is available for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
shooting overhead. These very high-speed fighters
are difficult to land, due to their speed, and are
suitable only for the highest-trained pilots.</p>

<p><b>Directing Artillery Fire.</b>—The friendly airplane
is sent out over the enemy’s positions, soars above
the target, sends back signals by wireless to the
friendly battery regarding the effect of fire; practically
dictating the success of artillery operations.</p>

<p><b>Reconnaissance.</b>—The friendly airplanes go out,
usually in squads for the sake of protection, and
observe by means of photographs or vision size of
enemy troops, batteries, trenches, lines of communication,
etc.; report the situation to headquarters
as a source of daily photographic record
of the operations of the enemy, to such an extent
that any change of the enemy’s position can be
analyzed. Of course the value of reconnaissance is
lessened when the enemy disguises his gun emplacements,
etc. In reconnaissance machines it is
important to have two persons, one to steer and
the other to scan the countryside. The reconnaissance
machine is therefore a two-place type
which may or may not have armament. It need
not be so fast, especially when convoyed by fighting
speed scouts. The two-place machines are frequently
used for fighting, in which case the pilot
will have a gun fixed to the body and shooting
through the propeller, and the passenger, especially
in German machines, will also have a gun mounted
in the turret so that it may be shot in a variety of
directions by the passenger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p><b>Bomb Dropping.</b>—This maneuver requires squad
flights to be of great value. The fundamental
characteristic of a bombing airplane is its ability
to carry great weight. Such machines are of
comparatively large size and not particularly fast.
Weight carrying is of course incompatible with
speed and climbing ability and therefore the
bombing machine must be a compromise if it is
to have any reasonable speed. It may be said that
airplanes compare very unfavorably with dirigible
balloons for bomb raids because the latter are able
to carry several tons of bombs as against the
airplane’s quarter of a ton.</p>

<p><b>Locating Submarines.</b>—For coast patrol or submarine
spotting, the airplane is an important factor,
for from an airplane it is possible to see for a considerable
depth into the water, and to locate hostile
submarines.</p>

<p><b>Training Student Aviators.</b>—The training machine
on which prospective aviators secure their
flying instruction may be considered as a type in
which great speed and power is not essential, but in
which reliability and ease of control is desirable. The
typical military training airplane in this country is a
single-motor tractor of moderate horsepower (about
100) having of course the seats in tandem and
furnished with dual control so that operation may be
from either pilot’s or passenger’s seat. The dual-control
system of training which prevails in this
country differs from the French method of starting
the pupil out alone to try his wings; it enables the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
pilot to keep a constant eye upon the pupil’s control
manipulations and to correct them instantly
whenever they are in error before any damage is
done. A possible improvement in the dual-control
training machine will be the substitution of side by
side seats for tandem seats. At present, communication
is difficult due to the great noise of the motor;
but with the adoption of side by side seats such as is
used in naval training schools, the pilot and pupil
will be able to communicate to better advantage.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Types of Airplanes.</b>—To suit the foregoing purposes
flying machines exist in seven distinct different
shapes at the present time, namely: monoplanes, biplanes,
triplanes, single-motor tractors, single-motor
pushers, double-motor machines and marine airplanes.
The last four types may be either monoplanes,
biplanes or triplanes. In order to understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
the adoption of one or the other type for
military use, it is well to run over the characteristics
of the seven types mentioned.</p>

<p><b>Monoplanes.</b>—The simplest form of airplane is the
monoplane which is fashioned after the manner of a
bird (see Fig. <a href="#fig_34">34</a>). There are two things to say in
favor of the monoplane: first, that the passengers
have an unobstructed view forward and range of gun
fire upward because there is no wing above them;
second, the aerodynamic efficiency of the monoplane
is superior to any other type. But when the bird
design is applied to a man-carrying apparatus, it
becomes impracticable to construct spars to take the
place of the bird’s wing bones; and therefore to give
the wings proper strength it becomes necessary to
truss them with numerous tension wires stretching
from the running gear out to various portions of the
wings. There are also wires running from a vertical
mast above the body to a point on the top part of the
wing; these wires, while they give the wing no added
strength during a flight, are necessary in order that
the shock of landing shall not break the wings off
sharp at the shoulder. It is characteristic of monoplane
construction that from a point below the
body and also from a point above the body a number
of heavy wires run outward to various points on
the wings; and it may be said that the strength to be
secured from this construction is not all that could
be desired.</p>

<p><b>Biplanes.</b>—The biplane is an improvement over
the monoplane from the latter standpoint; in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
biplane there are two parallel surfaces separated by
vertical sticks or struts, thus forming parallelograms
which are susceptible of being trussed by means of
tension-wire diagonals in a manner familiar and well
understood in case of bridges. It is possible to
build up biplane wings of great rigidity and strength
by this system, much more easily than in case of
monoplanes. However, the biplane type is from the
standpoint of efficiency inferior to the monoplane.
This is due to the fact that the vacuum above the
bottom wing which is so necessary for high duty is
somewhat interfered with by the upper wing; thus
while in a biplane the upper wing operates about as
efficiently as it would operate in a monoplane, yet
the lower wing has its efficiency materially reduced
and the resulting overall efficiency of a biplane compared
area for area with the monoplane is about 85
per cent. as great. However, recent developments
of the airplane have more or less put efficiency in the
background and as a result today the biplane is more
popular than the monoplane. In addition to the
greater strength of biplane wings their span may be
less than the monoplane for the same supporting
area. This makes them less unwieldy. Moreover,
for certain reasons a biplane machine of high speed
may be landed at a lower speed than equivalent
monoplanes.</p>

<p><b>Triplanes.</b>—What is true of the biplane is more
true in almost every item of the triplane, that is, it
is comparatively strong, compact, and of low landing
speed, but of reduced efficiency.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p><b>Single-Motor Tractors</b>.—The single-motor tractor
received its name simply because the propeller is
in front and draws the machine forward; but this
location of the propeller necessitates a distinct type
of airplane, wherein the power plant is located at the
very nose of the machine. The tractor type has the
pilot and passenger located in or to the rear of the
wings in order that their weight may balance the
weight of the motor. This means that the view and
range of fire of the passengers is obstructed in a forward
direction by the wings, and in machines such
as the U. S. training machine, the passenger, who is
practically in the center of the wings, can not look
directly upward nor directly downward. Moreover,
as concerns gun fire, the propeller of a tractor
obstructs the range straight ahead. In the tractor
the tail is supported at the rear and on the same
body which contains the motor and passengers; this
body constitutes a stream-line housing for the
machinery, seats, etc., and therefore has low wind
resistance. The tractor is a very shipshape design,
compact and simple and is at present the prevailing
type on the European war front. However, it has
disadvantages which are only overcome in other
types. One of these disadvantages is of course the
obstruction to range of gun fire. The present
practice in fighting airplanes is simply to shoot the
gun straight through the circle of rotation of the propeller
on the assumption that most of the bullets
will get through and that those which hit the shank
of the propeller blade will be deflected by proper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>armoring. An attempt is made to insure that all the
shots will get through by connecting the gun mechanism
mechanically to the motor shaft in such a way
that bullets will be discharged only at the instant
when their path is unobstructed by a propeller
blade. This practice is possible of course only in
guns which are fixed immovably to the airplane.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">Crew in front, motor and propeller in the rear, tail support on outriggers.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><b>Single-motor Pusher Airplanes.</b>—The pusher
type has popularity because the propeller and motor
rotate to the rear of the passenger, who takes his
place in the very front of the body and has an open
range of vision and gun fire downward, upward and
sideways. Another point in favor of the pusher is
that the oil and fumes of the motor do not blow into
his face as in the case of the tractor. The disadvantage
of the pusher is that the motor, being located
behind the pilot, will be on top of him in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
case of a fall. Another disadvantage is that the
body can not be given its shipshape stream-line form
because to do so will interfere with the rotation
of the propeller. Therefore, the body is abruptly
terminated just to the rear of the wings and it is
just long enough to hold the passenger and the
motor, the propeller sticking out behind. The
tail surfaces are then attached to the airplane by
means of long outriggers springing from the wing
beams at points sufficiently far from the propeller
axis so as not to interfere with the propeller.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">Two 100 h.p. motors; speed 85 mi. per hr.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><b>Double-motor Machines.</b>—In order to combine
the advantages of the tractor and pusher types and
eliminate their disadvantages, the double-motor machines
have been developed. In these there is no
machinery whatever in the body either in front or
back, and the passengers may take seats at the extreme
front as is desirable. The body then tapers
off to the rear in stream-line form and supports the
tail surfaces. The power plants are in duplicate
and one is located to each side of the body out on
the wings. It is customary to enclose each of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
these two motors in a casing so that the whole
power plant presents a more or less stream-line
shape to the wind, the propellers projecting from
the front or rear of these stream-line shapes. It may
be said that in the double-motor airplane it makes
very little difference whether the propeller is in
front or behind so that while a “twin-motor” machine
may be more accurately specified as a “twin-motor
pusher” or a “twin-motor tractor,” it is
usually sufficient indication of a machine’s characteristics
to call it a twin-motor machine.</p>

<p>By adopting this twin-motor form we bring in new
disadvantages. One of these is due to the fact that
the heavy motors are now located some distance
from the center of gravity of the machine. This
requires stronger supporting members between the
motor and the body. It also makes the lateral control
comparatively logy for now the heavy masses
are far from the center of gravity, resisting the
pilot’s efforts to use the lateral control. The second
disadvantage in the twin-motor type results from
possible stoppage of either motor. In this case, of
course, the propelling force is some distance off
center and is also reduced to one-half its value requiring
energetic exercise of the control wheel to
maintain equilibrium. It is reported, however, that
twin machines can continue to fly and even climb
with only one motor running. In this country the
twin-motor type has not developed as was hoped at
first, and on the European firing lines it is not so
numerous as the single-motor tractor type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p><b>Marine Airplanes</b>.—The possibility of mechanical
flight having once been established and wheels having
been applied to the airplane so that it could start
from and land on the ground, the logical next step
was to substitute some form of boat for the wheels so
that flights could be made over the water.</p>

<p>Experiments were made in France by M. Fabre in
this direction and in this country by G. H. Curtiss.
The latter, in his flight down the Hudson from Albany
to New York, equipped his airplane with a
light float to provide against forced landing in the
river. Pursuing this general idea he made some experiments
under the auspices of Alexander Graham
Bell’s Aerial Experiment Association, in which a
canoe was substituted for the wheels, and in which
an attempt was made to start from the surface of
the water. Success did not come at first and this
plan gave no satisfaction. Curtiss next turned his
attention to the hydroplane type of boat and made
a series of experiments at San Diego. The hydroplane
appeared to be much better adapted to his
purpose than the canoe had been, and he was able
to obtain success.</p>

<br>

<p><b>The Hydro-airplane (or “Seaplane”).</b>—From
analogy to the airplane one might at first imagine
that a suitable hydroplane would have a wide span
and fore and aft length; but such proportion would
give a very poor stability on the water, and would
require auxiliary hydroplanes in the same way that
an airplane requires auxiliary guiding surfaces. So
Curtiss, with his customary eye for simplicity and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>convenience, adopted a type of hydroplane which
had the general proportions of an ordinary boat,
<em>i.e.</em>, was long and narrow, thus obviating the necessity
of auxiliary hydroplanes at the tail of the machine.
To prevent the machine’s tipping over
sidewise, “wing pontoons” were attached at the
lower wing tips to prevent capsizing.</p>

<p><b>The Flying Boat.</b>—In the early hydro-airplane,
which was thus developed, the motor and pilot were
above in the usual position in the wings, while the
hydroplane itself was a considerable distance below
the wings. Thus there was a good deal of head
resistance. Curtiss set about reducing this head
resistance as far as possible and tried to incorporate
the pilot’s seat with the hydroplane pontoon. The
outcome of his endeavor was that he developed a
boat with a tapering stern. The pilot, gasoline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
tanks, etc., are located inside of the hull; the tapering
stern provides a backbone to which the tail surfaces
can be readily attached; the wings fixed to the
sides of the hull in a manner analogous to the wing
fastenings of the modern military airplane; and the
motor alone remains exposed to the wind. This is
the flying boat; its action on the water is analogous
to the action of the hydroplane for the bottom of
this boat hull is made in hydroplane form; indeed,
in the latest types of flying boat, the hydroplane
area is increased by extending it to right and left
of the boat hull. The flying boat is an ingenious
combination, wherein the characteristics of the
hydroplane are combined with the seaworthiness
of the ordinary boat, and at the same time wind
resistance is reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>The hydro-airplane remains in use, however,
being preferable to the flying boat for certain purposes,
and often is termed seaplane.</p>

<p><b>Future of the Airplane.</b>—In order to be commercially
successful and have a commercial future after
the war, the following weak points in airplane design
must be rectified.</p>

<p>1. <em>Motor.</em>—Airplane motors are imperfect and
unreliable at present and there must be considerable
progress before this type of motor which is very
light and delicate can be considered as reliable or
can be made in large enough quantities to cut down
the cost.</p>

<p>2. <em>Landing.</em>—The necessity of landing at considerable
speed, say 40 to 50 miles per hour, requires
a wide flat space, such as is not easy to find, and if
the present type of airplane is to become commercially
numerous, a large number of landing fields
must be developed all over the country.</p>

<p>3. <em>Danger.</em>—The airplane is by no means so dangerous
as the public has been led to think from the
exploits of the daredevil circus performers of the
past 10 years; with careful manipulation it will make
trips day after day without any damage. However,
it is not a foolproof machine and there remains an
element of danger on this account, which it is hoped
will one day be eliminated.</p>

<p><b>Future Uses of the Airplane.</b>—Future uses of the
airplane are many after the war is over. The postal
service of several governments are considering this
means of mail delivery; the sports use as in the past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
will continue to flourish; express carrying may be
expected in inaccessible countries where railroads
and roads do not give access and where high-speed
delivery by countless airplanes would aid materially
in the development of newly opened countries. For
airplane transportation will require no expensive
right-of-way, rubber-tire renewals, etc. Minor uses
of airplanes are on such duties as forest-fire patrol,
working at life-saving stations, etc.</p>

<p><b>American Airplane Industries.</b>—The magnitude
of the airplane industry in this country is great,
although not so great as in Europe. Leading business
men have invested in this industry with the firm
belief that it will become a profitable one, irrespective
of war. We see a number of leading bankers
and also automobile manufacturers in various parts
of the country putting their money into this new
industry. Now that a great demand has sprung up
on our side of the water for airplanes, we will expect
to see this industry increase more rapidly still. The
only result can be, from all the interest and importance
attached to aviation, that after the war is over,
large commercial uses will develop which will offer
employment to those who go into the work at this
time for military reasons. No one can predict
exactly what turn the situation will take, but there
is every indication that aviation has graduated from
the primary class of experimental work and is to be
considered now as an industry along with the automobile
business, motor-boat business, etc.</p>

<span class="bold">PRINCIPLES OF FLIGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Support of an Airplane by Its Wings.</b>—An airplane
is supported just as definitely as though on
top of a post, and by the same law, namely reaction.
If you try to sweep the air downward with a wing
held at a slight angle, the air just before it consents
to be pushed downward, delivers a momentary reaction
which is upward. If you have a bag of air
in your hand it exerts no push upward of course;
but the minute you give it a quick push downward
it resists, due to its inertia, thus delivering an
upward “reaction” against your hand.</p>

<p>Whenever you move anything, it reacts an
amount just equal to the force that is moving it;
if you move a bullet out of a gun, just before starting
the bullet reacts and you have “kick.” If
you should shoot a thousand guns downward, the
reaction would be considerable, and for the instant
might be sufficient to support heavy weight.</p>

<p>The airplane is a device for pushing downward
millions of little bullets, made out of air and exceedingly
small and light. The wing of an airplane
sweeps through these bullets, or molecules,
of air like a horizontal plow, wedges the particles
downward in vast numbers and in a continual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
stream, making up in amount what is lacking in
weight, so that as long as the airplane rushes along,
there are many thousands of cubic feet of air forced
down beneath its wings, delivering up a reaction
that results in complete support for the machine.
This reaction is just as definite and secure as though
the machine were supported from the ground on
wheels, but it disappears entirely when the airplane
is at rest. Part of the whir of a training machine
as it glides back to earth is made by the air driven
downward from the wings; the same phenomenon
may be noticed when a bat flies close to your ears
at night, and if you were a few feet below the airplane
as it flew, you would feel the rush of air
driven downward from its wings (see Fig. <a href="#fig_16">16</a>).</p>

<p>The net result of all the reactive pushes from this
air is <b>lift</b>. It may amount to several pounds for
every square foot of the wing surface.</p>

<p>This is all that need be said about why the air
supports an airplane; all you have to remember
is that as long as you have the forward sweeping
movement, you will have the lift.</p>

<p>The forward movement is absolutely essential,
however, and to maintain it requires a lot of horsepower
and gasoline. For it is by means of the
engine and propeller that this forward movement
is maintained. The engine is a device for creating
forward movement—the propeller drives the machine
ahead in exactly the same way as is the case
in a torpedo, or steamboat.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>—Relative path of air particles past an airplane.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">This diagram illustrates the general downward trend of the stratum of air met by the wings.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><b>Lift.</b>—Assuming that we have all the forward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>motion needed, let us now investigate the lift that
results. Experimenters such as the Wrights and
others have found out how to get this lift most conveniently.
Lift depends upon the four following
factors:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">1. Area.<br>
2. Density of air.<br>
3. Angle of incidence.<br>
4. Speed of motion.</p>
</div>

<p>1. <em>Relation of Area of Wings to Support.</em>—Consider
a small wing; suppose it to be held by hand
outside a train window in a given attitude, its area
being 1 sq. ft. It tends to lift a certain amount,
say 5 lb. Now increase its size to 2 sq. ft. and it
will lift with 10-lb. force, tending to get away from
your grasp. Rule: When only the area of a wing
is changed, its lift varies with the area. If, as
above mentioned, you can get 5 lb. of lift from each
square foot of wing surface, you can by the same
sign get 10-lb. of lift from 2 sq. ft. And if you
have 500 sq. ft. of surface you can get 2500 lb. of
lift.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_17" style="max-width: 45.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig_17.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span>—Diagram showing that in fast airplanes wings are small;

<p class="center no-indent fs90">(Above) Small wings; speed 115 mi. per hr.; for fighting. One seat.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">(Below) Large wings; speed 80 mi. per hr.; for reconnaissance. Two seats.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Regarding <b>area</b> of wing surface, the pilot does
not have to worry in a flight since he can do nothing
to change it anyway. All he needs to know
is that in different airplanes small wing area accompanies
high speed and small weight-carrying
capacity, as in the case of the Fokker and Sopwith
speed scouts (see Fig. <a href="#fig_17">17</a>). Conversely, large
wing areas are used for heavy load carrying and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>slow speed (see Fig. <a href="#fig_18">18</a>). Speed and weight-carrying
capacity thus appear to be antagonistic
and can not both be attained with efficiency, but
only at the expense of enormous power. The incompatibility
between high speed and weight carrying
keeps the designer busy in efforts toward a
reconciliation.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_18" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig_18.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>—Diagram showing use of large wings for heavy airplanes,
and small wings for light airplanes.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>2. <em>Density.</em>—The second factor affecting the lift
is the character of the air itself. I refer to the
density of the air. The heavier each particle of
air becomes, the more reaction it can furnish to
the wing that drives it downward; so on days when
the barometer is high the wing will lift more than
on other days. Now the air is heaviest, or most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
dense, right near the ground; because in supporting
the 50 miles or so of air above it, it becomes compressed
and has more weight per cubic foot. Therefore,
the wing gets more lift at a low altitude than
at a high. Some airplanes will fly when low down
but won’t fly at all high up. In Mexico, for instance,
when the punitive expedition started out they
were already at an altitude of several thousand feet
above sea level. The airplanes had been built
for use at places like New York and England, close
to sea level, and when our army officers tried to
fly with them in Mexico, they would not fly
properly, and the factory had to redesign them.</p>

<p>Regarding <em>density</em>, the pilot should know that
for a low density he should theoretically get a high
speed. As density decreases, high up in the air,
the speed tends to increase, and moreover he gets
more speed for the same amount of gasoline. Unfortunately,
at an altitude the motor power falls
off, so that nowadays the speed is not faster high
up than low down; but when the motor builders
succeed in designing their motors to give the same
horsepower at 20,000 ft. as they do on the ground,
airplanes will be able to reach terrific speed by
doing their work above the clouds.</p>

<p>It is found desirable to give large wings to airplanes
which are going to fly at high altitudes, so
as to offset the lack of density by an increase in
area, thus leaving the angle range—that is, the
speed range—as large as possible. The army airplanes
in Mexico mentioned above were simply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
given a new set of larger wings to offset the lower
air density in Mexico, and thereafter flew better.</p>

<p>3. <em>Angle of Incidence.</em>—The angle of incidence is
defined as the <em>angle between the wing-chord and the
line of flight</em>. The line of flight is the direction of
motion of the airplane, and is distinct from the axis
of the airplane which corresponds with the line of
flight only for a single angle of incidence. If the
line of flight is horizontal, the airplane may be
flying tail-high, tail-level, or tail-low; that is, its
axis may have varying positions for a given line of
flight. This is true, if the line of flight is inclined,
as in climbing. It is a mistake to confuse the line
of flight with the axis of the machine.</p>

<p>The angle of incidence of the wings of the U. S.
training machine may have any value from 15°
down. When the angle is smaller the lift of the
wings is smaller. Consider the model wing held
out of a train window; if its front edge is tilted up to
an angle of 15° with the line of motion it will lift
say 1 lb.; if reduced to a 10° angle, it will lift less,
say ⅔ lb. A model of the training-machine wing
could be tilted down to an angle several degrees less
than zero before its lift disappeared, because it is a
curved, not a flat wing; this angle would be the
“neutral-lift” angle; notice then that O° is not a
neutral-lift angle, and therefore may be used in
flight.</p>

<p>If the model wing were tilted up to an angle
greater than 15°, the lift would not increase any
more, but would be found to decrease. For this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
wing, 15° is called the critical, or “Stalling”
angle, beyond which it is unwise to go.</p>

<p>4. <em>Velocity.</em>—If the model wing which is imagined
to be held out of the car window, is held now in a
fixed position at a given angle of incidence, any
change of the train’s speed will result in a change
of lift; should the speed rise from 30 miles per
hour to double this value, the lift would increase
enormously, fourfold in fact.</p>

<p>Lift varies as the square of the speed. Thus any
increase or decrease of speed results in a great increase
or decrease of lift.</p>

<p><b>Interdependence of Angle of Incidence and
Velocity.</b>—The four factors above mentioned all
contribute to the lift; if in an airplane wing each
factor be given a definite value, the resulting lift is
determined according to the formula:</p>

<p class="center no-indent"><em>L = KrAV<sup>2</sup></em></p>

<table class="autotable">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">where</td>
<td class="tdlx"><em>L</em> is lift.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdlx"><em>K</em> is a coefficient referring to the angle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdlx"><em>A</em> is the area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdlx"><em>V</em> is the velocity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdlx"><em>r</em> is the density.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p class="no-indent">Two only of these quantities change materially in
flight, the angle and the velocity; the lift itself remains
substantially the same under most normal
circumstances. The angle always changes simultaneously
with the velocity, increasing when the
velocity decreases. Thus the drop of lift due to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
velocity decrease is balanced by gain of lift due to
angle increase, and the lift remains unchanged when
speed changes.</p>

<p>Speed change then requires that the pilot alter
the angle of incidence simultaneously with the
throttle; so there are two things to do, unlike the
case of the automobile where only the throttle is
altered.</p>

<p><b>Minimum Speed.</b>—When, in slowing up an airplane,
the angle of incidence reaches the 15° limit,
no further decrease of speed is allowable; therefore,
the critical angle determines the minimum limit
of speed. If for any reason the machine exceeds
the 15° limit, it must speed up to gain support; that
is, the pilot has to increase angle and speed simultaneously
instead of oppositely.</p>

<p><b>Efficiency of Airplane Wings.</b>—I said at the beginning
of this chapter that the airplane was a
device for pushing down an enormous quantity of
air. A certain amount of force has to be furnished
in order to keep the airplane moving, and this force
is furnished by the engine and propeller. The
propeller by giving a certain amount of push in a
horizontal direction to the airplane wing enables
this wing to extract from the air ten or twenty
times this amount of push in a vertical direction;
that is, the airplane wing will give you 10 lb. or
more of lifting in exchange for 1 lb. of push.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span></p>

<p class="fs90">Lift and Drift.—Lift is perpendicular to line of flight, drift is parallel.</p>

<p class="fs90">Angle of Incidence.—Wing in position shown has angle of 5° if moving in
direction “A,” 10° if in direction “B;” and a negative angle of 4° if moving in
direction “C.” In the last case it is moving along its neutral-lift-line, lift
becomes zero.
</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The propeller push is necessary to overcome the
drift or resistance of the wings to forward motion.
It appears then that the airplane wing as it moves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
through the air has two forces on it, one acting
straight up and called “lift,” the other acting
straight back and called “drift” (see Fig. <a href="#fig_19">19</a>). The
lift is several times greater than the drift, and the
situation is quite analogous to that of a kite,
which rises upward in the air due to its lift but at
the same time drifts backward with the wind due
to its drift. In the case of the kite the string takes
up an angle which just balances the joint effect of
the lift and drift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>The efficiency of an airplane wing is indicated by
the ratio of lift to drift, and for a given lift, the
efficiency is best, therefore, for small drift. If the
lift is 1900 lb. and the wing drift 190 lb.,</p>

<p>Wing efficiency = Lift or weight/Wing drift = <span class="xs"><sup>1900</sup>/<sub>190</sub></span> = 10</p>

<p><b>Factors Determining Best Efficiency.</b>—It goes
without saying that an airplane wing should attain
the best efficiency it can, and there are several ways
of doing this.</p>

<p>The first relates to the question of angle of incidence;
we have already discussed the effect of angle
on lift, but when we come to discuss its effect on
efficiency we find that there is only one angle at
which we can get the best efficiency. This is a
small angle, about 3° to 6°; at this angle the lift is
nowhere near as much as it would be at 10° or 15°,
but the drift is so small compared to the lift that it is
found desirable in airplanes to employ these small
angles for normal flight. As the angle increases
above this value of maximum efficiency, the efficiency
drops off, and when you get up to the stalling
angle, the efficiency becomes very low indeed (see
Fig. <a href="#fig_20">20</a>).</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_20" style="max-width: 41.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig_20.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span>—Wing characteristics.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">Curves showing lift, drift, efficiency, and center of pressure travel of typical
training-airplane wing, as determined in Aerodynamical Laboratory.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The second way to get good efficiency is to choose
the shape of the wings properly. For instance,
early experimenters tried to get results with flat
wings, and failed completely, for the flat wing
proved to be very inefficient. When it was observed
that birds had curved wings, this principle was applied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>to early experiments and then for the first
time man was able to obtain support in a flying
machine. The fundamental principle of efficiency
in wings is that they must be curved, or cambered, as
it is sometimes called. This is because as the wing
rushes onward it wants to sweep the air downward
smoothly and without shock, as can be done only
when the wing is curved (see air flow, Fig. <a href="#fig_21">21</a>).</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_21" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig_21.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span>—Efficiency of curved and flat wing.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">(<em>a</em>) Air flow past curved wing is smooth without much eddying; (<em>b</em>) air flow
past flat wing produces eddies above it.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The question of wing curvature is exceedingly
important then; we find that the curvature of its
upper surface is particularly so. We notice that
airplane wings all have a certain thickness in order
to enclose the spars and ribs; it is not necessarily a
disadvantage for them to be thick, due to the fact
that the upper curve of the wing does most of the
lifting anyway, and the lower side is relatively
unimportant. You can make the lower surface
almost flat, without much hurting the effect of the
wing, so long as the upper surface remains properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
curved. However, the upper surface must be accurately
shaped, and is so important that in some
machines we find cloth is not relied on to maintain
this delicate shape, but thin wood veneer is used (I
refer to the front upper part of the wing). In
general, then, wings are thick toward the front and
taper down to a thin trailing edge.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">Note in biplane reduced vacuum on bottom wing.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>You may wonder how it was found that the upper
surface of the wing was the most important; and I
will say that this was one of the interesting discoveries
of the early history of aerodynamics.
People at first thought that a wing sweeping through
the air derived its support entirely from the air
which struck the bottom of the wing, and they
assumed that if the bottom of the wing were properly
shaped, the top did not matter; that is, all the
pressure in the air was delivered up against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
bottom surface. But a French experimenter conceived
the idea of inserting little pressure gages at
various points around the wing. He found, it is
true, that there was considerable pressure exerted
in the air against the bottom of the wing; but he
found a more surprising fact when he measured the
condition above the wing. When he applied his
gage to the upper surface of the wing, it read backward,
that is, showed a vacuum, and a very pronounced
one. He found that there was a vacuum
sucking the top part of the wing upward twice as
hard as the pressure underneath was pushing; so
that two-thirds of the total lift on this wing was due
to vacuum above it (see Fig. <a href="#fig_22">22</a>).</p>

<p>In the diagram the shaded area on top of the wing
represents vacuum above, that below the wing
represents pressure beneath.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span>—Wings of small and large aspect ratio</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><b>Aspect Ratio.</b>—The third factor in wing efficiency
has to do with the plan shape. It was early found
that square wings were not much good, and that if
you made them wide in span like those of a bird, the
efficiency was best (see Fig. <a href="#fig_23">23</a>). Aspect ratio is
the term which gives the relation of the span to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
the fore and aft dimension of the wing, and this
relation is usually equal to six or so. The reason
why large aspect ratios are advantageous is as
follows:</p>

<p>The tips of all wings are inefficient, because they
allow the air to slip sideways around the ends, and
there is all the trouble of disturbing this air without
extracting any considerable lift from it. In a wide-span
wing these inefficient wing tips are only a small
percentage of the total area, but in a small-span
wing they may be an important consideration (see
Fig. <a href="#fig_24">24</a>).</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_24" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

<p class="center no-indent fs90">Arrows show direction of air flow past plate; note that air escapes sideways
around sides of plate. This phenomenon occurs at the tips of all airplane wings
and accounts for small efficiency of narrow-span wings.
</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><b>Wing Arrangements.</b>—All the foregoing remarks
in this chapter have applied only to a single wing.
They apply in general to double or triple wings (biplanes
and triplanes), but the matter of arranging
multiple wings affects the efficiency.</p>

<p>The monoplane with its single layer of wings is
the most efficient type of flying machine. We find
if we arrange wings into the biplane shape that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
presence of the upper wing interferes with the vacuum
formed above the lower wing, and the efficiency
decreases (see Fig. <a href="#fig_22">22</a>). The same is true of
the triplane and the quadruplane arrangement. If
all we wanted in airplanes was efficiency, we would
use monoplanes, but the biplane is pretty popular
now in spite of its low efficiency; this is because it
can be much more strongly trussed than the monoplane,
and also because of the fact that sufficient
area may be secured with less span of wings.</p>

<p>It may be said that the low efficiency of the biplane
can be somewhat relieved by spacing the upper
and lower wings at a considerable distance apart;
but if they are spaced at a distance much greater
than the chord, it requires extra long struts and
wires, and the resistance and weight of these will
offset the advantage of wider spacing; so that practically
biplane-wing efficiency may be taken as 85
per cent. of monoplane efficiency.</p>

<p>It remains to mention the tandem arrangement,
used in all airplanes, where the tail is a tandem surface
in conjunction with the wings. A surface
located in the position of an airplane tail is at a disadvantage
and shows low efficiency for flight purposes.
This is because the main wings deflect the
air downward and when the tail comes along it meets
air which has a more or less downward trend, instead
of encountering fresh, undisturbed air (see
Fig. <a href="#fig_16">16</a>).</p>

<p><b>Resistance of an Airplane to Motion.</b>—Earlier in
this chapter the support of an airplane was explained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
and it was seen that the weight was exactly equalled
by the lift or support; it was also explained that the
production of this lift required considerable force
in moving the wings rapidly through the air. It is
not only the wings, however, which require force to
overcome the resistance to motion. In order to
have any wings at all it is unfortunately necessary
to supply also struts, wires, etc., for bracing these
wings, also a motor and seat for the passenger,
which are usually included inside a fuselage, also
wheels for landing and various control surfaces.
None of these accessories to the wings contribute
material lift, but they involve a large amount of
resistance which is therefore a dead loss. Note
carefully that there are two distinct sorts of resistance:
(1) that of the wings, which is the necessary
price paid for securing lift; (2) that of all the rest of
the machine, in return for which nothing beneficial
is received, and which therefore has sometimes been
called “parasite” or “deadhead” resistance.</p>

<p>In a typical training machine the total resistance
to be overcome if forward motion is maintained is as
follows: (See Fig. <a href="#fig_26">26</a>.)</p>

<p>It is seen that the above resistance values total
to the highest figure at the lowest speed, and that
the lowest value of resistance occurs at an intermediate
speed; the resistance decreases as the speed
decreases from 73 to 57 miles per hour; but a further
decrease in speed finds the resistance running up
rapidly so that at minimum speed the resistance is
very great again. This is due to the fact that at
high speeds the deadhead resistance exceeds that of
the wings but at slow speeds although the deadhead
resistance is very small, the wings being turned up
to a large angle within the air, have a resistance
which is at its maximum. This seems clear enough
when we remember that the lift of the wings remains
the same as the angle decreases (and speed goes up)
but that the efficiency of the wings increases so that
the wing resistance is a smaller fraction of the lift
at high speed than at low speed.</p>

<p><b>Cause of Resistance.</b>—Wing resistance, which
is affected, as mentioned previously, by the wing
curvature, can not be decreased unless new and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
improved sorts of wings are invented. As to deadhead
resistance, it may be decreased in future by
methods of construction which eliminate unessential
parts. In a high-speed airplane in this country
an attempt was made to eliminate the wires altogether
and most of the struts (because the wiring
is one of the largest single items of deadhead resistance);
so far the attempt has failed for structural
reasons. In the monoplane type of airplane of
course the struts are eliminated, which is an advantage
from the standpoint of resistance.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_25" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig_25.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span>—Diagram illustrating advantage of stream-line shape.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">Note large eddy disturbance and vacuum behind round shape, causing high
resistance.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>As long as struts, wires, etc., are used at all, the
minimum resistance can be secured by giving them
a proper “stream-line” shape. The stream-line
shape is one in which the thickest part is in front
and tapers off to a point in the rear, like a fish. If,
for instance, we take round rods instead of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
struts of the training machine above mentioned and
having the same thickness, the resistance might be
80 lb. instead of 20 lb.; and if we take a rod whose
shape is elliptical with its axes in a ratio of 1 to 5
the resistance might be 40 lb. instead of 20 lb.; and
if we took the stream-line struts out of the training
machine and put them back sharp edge foremost, the
resistance would be increased. The advantage of
the stream-line shape is that it provides smooth lines
of flow for the air which has been thrust aside at the
front to flow back again without eddies to the rear.
This is not possible in the case of the round strut,
behind which will be found a whirl of eddies resulting
in a vacuum that tends to suck it backward. By
fastening a stream-line tail behind the round rod the
eddies are greatly reduced, as is the vacuum. The
wires of the airplane are subject to the same law and
if the training machine above mentioned had
stream-line wires instead of round wires we might
expect them to have less than 70 lb. resistance. The
fuselage should always be given as nearly a stream-line
shape as the presence of the motor and tanks
will permit; and it must all be inclosed smoothly in
“doped” fabric in order that the air-flow phenomena
may operate. As for the wheels, they must of necessity
be round, but by enclosing them with fabric
the air flow past them is more easy and the resistance
may be halved.</p>

<p><b>Total Resistance.</b>—The necessity has been explained
of discriminating between wing and deadhead
resistance; if we are talking about wings we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
may ignore everything except the wing resistance
(commonly called “wing drift”), but if we are talking
about the whole airplane, we then must refer to
the total resistance, which includes all the others
and is overcome by the propeller thrust. “Skin-friction”
resistance has not been mentioned nor
need it be more than to say that any surface moving
through air attributes part of its resistance to the
actual friction of the air against it, and therefore
should be as smooth as possible.</p>

<p><b>Motor Power Required for Flying.</b>—The reason
resistance interests us is that motor power is required
to propel the airplane against it; more and
more power as the resistance and speed increase.
Obviously, the power required is least when the resistance
is small, <em>i.e.</em>, when the speed is intermediate
between minimum and maximum. It takes
more power to fly at minimum speed than at this
intermediate speed. Of course it also takes more
power to fly at maximum speed, where again the
resistance is high.</p>

<p><b>Maximum Speed.</b>—Ordinarily, for moderate
speeds, airplanes have a margin of power at which
the throttle need not be opened wide; should speed
be increased the resistance and horsepower required
will increase steadily until the throttle is wide open
and motor “full out;” this establishes the maximum
speed of an airplane; there is no margin of
power, no climb is possible. The only way to increase
speed is to use the force of gravity in addition
to the motor force. It may be interesting to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
what is the maximum possible speed in the case of a
vertical dive with the motor shut off; it will be about
double the maximum horizontal speed as may be
readily seen from the fact that the thrust in the direction
of motion is now no longer horizontal and
equal to the resistance but is vertical and equal to
the weight of the machine; that is, the thrust may be
increased fivefold, and the speed resulting will be
increased correspondingly, if the motor be running
in such a vertical dive the velocity may be slightly
increased though at this speed of motion the propeller
would not have much efficiency.</p>

<p>There is danger in such high speeds; the stresses
in the machine are increased several times merely by
the increased resistance, and if the angle of incidence
should be suddenly brought up to a large value at
this high speed the stress would again be increased
so that the total stress increase theoretically might
be as high as fourteen times the normal value, thus
exceeding the factor of safety. It is for such reasons
that the maximum strength is desirable in
airplanes; holes must not be carelessly drilled in the
beams but should be located if anywhere midway
between the top and bottom edges, where the stress
will be least; initial stresses, due to tightness of the
wires, should not be too great.</p>

<p><b>Climbing Ability.</b>—Climbing ability refers to the
number of feet of rise per minute or per 10 min.
In order to climb, extra horsepower is required
beyond that necessary for more horizontal flight.
The machine can, for instance, fly at 56 miles per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
hour at which speed it requires 43 hp. If now
the throttle is opened up so as to increase the horsepower
by 22, making a total of 65 hp., the machine
will climb at the rate of 380 ft. per minute, maintaining
approximately the same flight speed. If
instead of 65 hp., it were 54 hp. the speed of climb
would be about one-half of the 380, or 190 ft. per
minute; the flight speed again remaining approximately
as before; that is, any margin of horsepower
beyond the particular value of horsepower required
may be used for climbing without material change of
the flight speed. It is necessary here to state that
lift does not increase during climb; and while for the
instant that a climb commences there may be, due
to acceleration, more lift on the wings than balances
the weight, this does not remain true after a
steady rate of climb is reached. To illustrate, in
a wagon drawn uphill by horses the wheels which
support the wagon do not exert any more support
than on the level, and the entire force to make the
wagon ascend is supplied through extra hard pulling
by the horses. Thus in a climbing airplane the
propeller furnishes all the climbing force and lift
is no greater than in horizontal flight. In fact, the
actual lift force may be even less, as the weight of
the airplane is partly supported by the propeller
thrust which is now inclined upward slightly.</p>

<p>To secure maximum climbing ability, we must
determine at what velocity the margin of motor
power is the greatest. In the above-mentioned
machine we know that the horsepower required for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
support is least for a speed of near 55 miles per hour,
and it is near speed where therefore the excess
margin of power is greatest and at which climbing
is best done. An airplane designed chiefly for
climbing must have low values of motor power
necessary for support, namely, must have small
resistance, therefore small size, therefore small
weight.</p>

<p><b>Gliding Angle.</b>—Gliding angle denotes the angle
at which the airplane will glide downward with
the motor shut off and is spoken of as 1 in 5, 1
in 6, etc., according as it brings the airplane 1 mile
down for each 5, 6, etc., miles of travel in the line
of flight. The gliding angle of a machine may be
found by dividing the total resistance into the
weight:</p>

<p class="center no-indent">
Gliding angle = Weight/Total resistance.<br>
</p>

<p>In the above-mentioned airplane it is one in 6.6
when the resistance is 288 lb., that is, when the
speed is 57 miles per hour. At any other speed the
resistance increases and hence the gliding angle
decreases. Hence the importance of putting the
airplane into its proper speed in order to secure the
best gliding angle.</p>

<p><b>The Propeller.</b>—The propeller or “screw,” by
screwing its way forward through the air, is able
to propel the airplane at the desired velocity.
Regarding principles of propeller action the matter
can be hastily summarized in the following brief
lines. The propeller blades may be regarded as
little wings moving in a circular path about the
shaft; and they have a lift and drift as do the regular
wings. The lift is analogous to the thrust; to secure
this thrust with least torque (drift) the blades are
set at their most efficient angle of incidence, and
while the blade appears to have a steep angle near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
the hub, it actually meets the air in flight at the
same angle of incidence from hub to tip.</p>

<p><b>Propeller Pitch.</b>—Pitch is best defined by analogy
to an ordinary wood-screw; if the screw is turned one
revolution it advances into the wood by an amount
equal to its pitch. If the air were solid, a propeller
would do the same, and the distance might be 8 ft.,
say. Actually the air yields, and slips backward,
and the propeller advances only 6 ft. Its “slip” is
then 8 minus 6, equals 2 ft., or 25 per cent. Such a
propeller has an 8-ft. pitch, and a 25 per cent. slip.</p>

<p>This “slip stream” blows backward in a flight
so that the tail of an airplane has air slipping past
it faster than do the wings. Hence the air forces
at the tail are greater than might be expected.
The rudder and elevators therefore give a quicker
action when the propeller is rotating than when, as
in the case of a glide, it is not.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p><b>Washout.</b>—Due to torque of the motor, the airplane
tends to rotate in the opposite direction to the
propeller. This tendency may be neutralized by
giving one wing tip a smaller angle of incidence,
called “washout,” so that the machine normally
tends to neutralize the torque-effect.</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLES OF AIRPLANE EQUILIBRIUM</h3>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_28" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>—Balances of forces in an airplane.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">Weight forward of lift, thrust below resistance. Thrust equals resistance,
weight equals lift.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><b>Introductory.</b>—Under this head will be discussed:
(<em>a</em>) features of airplane design which tend to maintain
equilibrium irrespective of the pilot; (<em>b</em>)
matters of voluntary controlling operations by the
pilot. As regards (<em>a</em>) the tendency of the airplane
toward inherent stability acts to oppose any deviation
from its course whether the pilot so desires
or not. The more stable is a machine, the less
delicately is it controlled, and the present consensus
of opinion among pilots is that a 50-50<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
compromise between stability and controllability is
the best thing.</p>

<p>In questions of airplane equilibrium the starting
point is the center of gravity; obviously, if the
center of gravity were back at the tail or up at the
nose there would be no balance; the proper place
for it is the same spot where all the other forces
such as thrust, lift and resistance act; there it is
easy to balance them all up. But it is not always
easy to bring the line of thrust and the line of total
resistance into coincidence, because the line of
thrust is the line of the propeller shaft and when
this is high up as in the case of some pushers it may
be several inches above the line of resistance.
And as the thrust is above the resistance there is a
tendency to nose the machine down; to balance
which the designer deliberately locates the center
of gravity sufficiently far behind the center of lift
so that there is an equal tendency to tip the nose
upward; and all four forces mentioned completely
balance each other. But things may happen to
change the amount or position of these forces
during flight, and if this does happen the first thing
to do is to restore the balance by bringing in a small
new force somewhere. In an actual airplane this
small restoring force is supplied at each critical
moment first, by the tail, etc., of the airplane and
second, by voluntary actions of the pilot. The
center of gravity of any airplane may be determined
easily by putting a roller under it and seeing where
it will balance, or by getting the amount of weight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
supported at the wheels and tail, according to the
method of moments.</p>

<p><b>Longitudinal Stability.</b>—Longitudinal stability
has to do with the tendency of an airplane to
maintain its proper pitching angle. It was said
above that the four forces of lift, resistance, thrust
and weight always exactly balanced due to their
size and their position. Now the first consideration
about longitudinal stability is that while the
centers of gravity and other forces remain in a fixed
position, the center of lift changes its position whenever
the angle of incidence (that is the speed) is
changed. The phenomenon of shift of center of
pressure applies only to the wings and to the lift
(the position of center of resistance remains practically
fixed at all angles).</p>

<p>Note the effect on center of pressure position of a
change of wing angle (see Fig. <a href="#fig_20">20</a>). The wing used
on the U. S. training machine has a center of lift
which is about in the middle of the wing when
flying at a small angle of maximum speed; but if
the angle is increased to the stalling angle of 15°,
the center of pressure moves from midway of the
wing to a point which is about one-third the chord
distance of the wing from the front edge. The lift
may travel about ½ foot, and it is equal in amount
to the weight of the machine (that is, nearly a ton),
and the mere effect of changing the angle from
its minimum to its maximum value therefore tends
to disturb the longitudinal equilibrium with a
force which may be represented as 1 ton acting on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
lever arm of ½ ft. Suppose that the airplane is
balancing at an angle of 2° so that the center of
gravity coincides with the center of lift for this
angle; now if a gust of wind causes the angle to
increase for an instant to 2¼°, the center of lift
will move forward and tend to push the front edge
of the wing up, thus increasing the angle further to
2½°. Then the center of lift, of course, moves
further forward to accommodate the increase of
angle, and in a fraction of a second the wing
would rear up unless it were firmly attached to the
airplane body and held in its proper position by the
tail. Similarly if for any reason the proper angle
of 2° were decreased, the same upset would follow,
only this time tending to dive the wing violently
to earth. This tendency is neutralized in an airplane
by the “Penaud Tail Principle.”</p>

<p>There are certain shapes of wings in which the
center of pressure travels in the reverse direction;
a flat plate, for example; or a wing having its rear
edge turned up so that the general wing shape is
like a thin letter “S.” Such wings as these would
not tend to lose their proper angle, because when the
angle is changed for any reason the center or pressure
in these wings moves in just the manner necessary
to restore them to their proper position; but
these wings are inefficient and are not in present
use on airplanes.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption">
<p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>—Diagrams illustrating theory and application of
longitudinal dihedral angle.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><b>The Penaud Tail Principle.</b>—<em>Rule.</em>—The horizontal
tail must have a smaller angle of incidence
than the wings. The upsetting force above mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
must be met by a strong opposite righting
force, and this latter is furnished by the horizontal
tail surface. In the angle of equilibrium of
2° above mentioned, the flat horizontal stabilizer will
perhaps have no force acting on it at all because it
is edgewise to the air and its angle of incidence is
zero. When the angle of the wing increases to 2¼°
and the lift moves forward tending to rear it up,
the wing being rigidly fastened to the body pushes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
the tail downward so that the tail now begins to
have a small lift force upon it due to its angle of ¼°;
and this newly created force, though small, acts at
such a long lever arm that it exceeds the rearing
force of the wing and will quickly restore the airplane
to 2°. This action depends upon the principle
of the Penaud Tail or longitudinal “Dihedral”
which requires that the front wings of an airplane
make a larger angle with the wind than the rear
surface. This principle holds good even when we
have rear surfaces which actually are lifting surfaces
in normal flight, the requisite being that the
wings themselves shall in such cases be at an even
greater angle than the tail. No mention has been
made of the elevator control, because its action is
additional to the above-mentioned stability. The
elevator is able to alter the lift on the tail; such
alteration requires, of course, immediate change of
angle of the wings so that equilibrium shall again
follow; and this equilibrium will be maintained until
the lift at the tail is again altered by some movement
of the elevator control. Thus the elevator may be
considered as a device for adjusting the angle of
incidence of the wings.</p>

<p>The air through which the wings have passed
receives downward motion, and therefore a tail
which is poised at zero angle with the line of flight
may actually receive air at an angle of -2° or -3°.
In the above case we would expect an actual downward
force on the tail, unless this tail is given a
slight arch on its top surface (for it is known that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
arched surfaces have an angle of zero lift which is
negative angle).</p>

<p><b>Longitudinal Control.</b>—Steering up or down is
done by the elevator, which as explained above is
merely a device for adjusting the angle of incidence
of the wings. The elevator controls like all the
other controls of an airplane depend for their quick
efficient action upon generous speed; they can not be
expected to give good response when the machine is
near its stalling speed. The elevators like the
rudder are located directly in the blast of the propeller
and in case the speed of motion should become
very slow, the elevators may be made to exert considerable
controlling force if the motor is opened up
to blow a strong blast against them. This is good
to bear in mind when taxying on the ground because
if the motor is shut off at the slow speed of motion
the elevator and rudder will lose their efficacy. The
propeller blast, due to a 25 per cent. slip, adds 25
per cent. of apparent speed to those parts which are
in its way, and therefore the tail forces are affected
as the square of this increase, that is, the forces may
be 50 per cent. greater with the propeller on than off.</p>

<p><b>Lateral Stability.</b>—This depends upon the keel
surface or total side area of an airplane. The keel
surface includes all the struts, wires, wheels, wings,
as well as body, against which a side wind can blow.
Skidding and side-slipping have the same effect as a
side wind, and the resulting forces acting against
the side of the machine should be made useful
instead of harmful. This is done by properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
proportioning the keel or side surface. If keel surface
is low, the side force will rotate the airplane
about its axis so that the windward wing sinks; if
high, so that it rises. But if the keel surface is at
just the right height (<em>i.e.</em>, level with the center of
gravity) the side forces will not rotate the machine
at all and will simply oppose the skidding without
upsetting equilibrium.</p>

</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><b>Lateral Dihedral.</b>—Now when an airplane appears
to have its keel-surface center too low, the
easiest way to raise it level with the center of
gravity is to give the wings a dihedral angle, that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
make them point upward and outward from the
body. Thus their projection, as seen in a side view,
is increased, and the effect is to add some keel surface
above the center of gravity, thus raising the
center of total keel surface.</p>

<p>A further advantage of the lateral dihedral is that
any list of the airplane sideways is automatically
corrected (see Fig. <a href="#fig_30">30</a>). The low wing supports
better than the high wing, because a side slip sets
in, hence will restore the airplane to level position.</p>

<p><b>Non-Skid-Fins.</b>—Where for the above-mentioned
purposes an excessive dihedral would be needed,
resort may be had to non-skid-fins erected vertically
edgewise to the line of flight above or beneath the
topwing. These are used in marine machines to
balance the abnormally large keel surface of the
boat or pontoon below.</p>

<p><b>Lateral Control.</b>—By means of ailerons, lateral
control is maintained voluntarily by the pilot;
the aileron on the low tip is given a greater angle of
incidence while on the high tip a less angle of
incidence thus restoring the proper level of the
machine. Notice that the efficacy of the ailerons
depends upon speed of motion of the airplane, irrespective
of propeller slip because the propeller slip
does not reach the ailerons. Therefore, at stalling
speeds the ailerons may not be expected to work at
their best, and when lateral balance is upset at
slow speeds it is necessary to dive the machine
before enough lateral control can be secured to
restore the balance.</p>

<p><b>Directional Stability.</b>—Directional stability has
to do with the tendency of an airplane to swerve to
the right or left of its proper course. To maintain
directional stability the “vertical stabilizer” is used,
which acts in a manner analogous to the feather on
an arrow. Thus in case of a side slip the tail will
swing and force the airplane nose around into the
direction of the side slip so that the airplane tends
to meet the relative side wind “nose-on” as it
should. The vertical stabilizer should not be too
large, however, as then any side pressure due to
deviation from a rectilinear course will cause the
machine to swerve violently; the wing which is outermost
in the turn will have preponderance of lift
due to its higher speed; that is, the airplane will get
into a turn where there is too much bank and a spiral
dive may result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p><b>Directional Control.</b>—The rudder gives directional
control in exactly the same way that it does
on a boat; it should be said, however, that the rudder
is sometimes used without any intention of changing
the direction, that is, it is used simultaneously with
the ailerons as a means of neutralizing their swerving
tendency. The ailerons, of course, at the same
time that they restore lateral balance create a disadvantageous
tendency to swerve the machine
away from its directional course; that is what the
rudder must neutralize. Moreover, the rudder is
frequently used against side winds to maintain rectilinear
motion.</p>

<p><b>Banking.</b>—Banking combines the lateral and
directional control, which should be operated simultaneously
so as to tilt the machine and at the same
time maintain the radius of turn. The wings are
tilted in a bank because in going around a curve of a
certain radius the weight of the machine creates a
centrifugal force in a horizontal direction and if the
curved path is to be maintained this centrifugal
force must be neutralized; and this is done by inclining
the force of lift inward until it has a horizontal
component equal to the centrifugal force.
That is why the angle of bank must be rigidly observed,
or else the inward component of the lift
will change. Now as soon as the wings bank up, the
lift force is no longer all vertical and therefore may
not be enough to support the weight of the machine.
To offset this have plenty of motor power for speed
in a bank; and do not try to climb while banking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>It is better to bank too little than too much; too
little results in skidding which may be easily cured;
too much results in side slipping inward and if the
tail surface is too great in this latter case, a spiral
dive may result—so look out for over banking.</p>

<p>It is better for the beginner in banking to move
his ailerons first and then move the rudder; for if he
moves the rudder first there will be skidding outward,
forward speed will drop and a stall may
result. On high angles of banking, over 45°, it
should be noted that the elevators are now more
nearly vertical than horizontal and operate as a
rudder; similarly the rudder’s function is reversed,
and to turn down the rudder will be used.</p>

<p><b>Damping in an Airplane.</b>—Above have been mentioned
the restoring forces which tend toward airplane
equilibrium. Now these restoring forces
tend to push the machine back to equilibrium and
even beyond in exactly the same way that gravity
causes a pendulum to swing about its point of equilibrium.
This can sometimes be noticed in the case
of an automobile when travelling at high speed along
country roads where a sort of slow oscillation from
side to side may be noticed due to the forceful maintenance
of equilibrium of the body in its forward
motion. This oscillation in an airplane would be
serious unless there were means of damping it out
and these means are: first, the wings; second, the
tail surfaces; third, the weight and inertia of the
machine itself. Regarding inertia it should be
said that a machine with weight distributed far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
from the center of gravity, such as the double-motor
airplane has a large tendency to resist the
rolling motions associated with lateral stability.
But from the same sign airplanes with large moment
of inertia are difficult to deviate from any given
attitude, and therefore have the name of being
“logy.” The proper proportioning of an airplane’s
parts to secure first, the restoring forces; second, the
proper damping force; third, the proper amount of
moment of inertia, is a very delicate matter and
beyond the scope of the present chapter.</p>

<span class="bold">FLYING THE AIRPLANE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Starting Off.</b>—The first thing to do before starting
off in an airplane is to inspect carefully everything
about the machine and assure yourself that
it is in perfect condition.</p>

<p>When all is ready to start turn the machine
directly against the wind; this is done in order that
the rise from the ground may be more quickly made
with the assistance of the wind under the wings,
and it has a more important advantage in the fact
that if you try to get off the ground across the wind
the machine will be very hard to balance. Birds
also take the air directly against the wind even
though for the moment this carries them in a direction
toward some supposed enemy, and it is a
fundamental principle in airdromes. Keep the
machine pointed into the wind for the first 200 ft.
of altitude (and similarly in landing face the wind
when within 200 feet of the ground). In case the
engine should fail before a height of 200 ft. is
reached, never turn down wind as this is extremely
dangerous.</p>

<p>Assistance will be had for the start from the
mechanics, or if away from the airdrome from bystanders.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
Have each assistant in his proper place
before starting the engine; one is to start the
propeller and the rest to hold back the machine
until ready to let go.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">This cut also illustrates proper landing attitude, since airplane is just
skimming the ground.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>In order to get off the ground you will want good
engine power; it takes considerable thrust to
accelerate an airplane on the ground to its flying
speed; in fact the first flying machine of the Wrights
had to use an auxiliary catapult to furnish the
thrust necessary to get them into the air. Making
sure that the motor is giving full power raise the
hand as a signal to the attendants to remove the
chocks and let go. As you start rolling forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
push the control lever forward which will raise the
tail off the ground and place the wings edgewise
to the wind while they will not offer resistance to
the acquiring of good rolling speed. Within a few
seconds the machine will have attained on the
ground a velocity not less than the low flying speed;
it will not rise, however, until the tail is lowered
by pulling the lever back. When the necessary
rolling speed is attained pull the lever softly backward;
the tail at once drops, the wings increase
their angle and lift and the machine will rise, the
lever being held in a fixed position (see Fig. <a href="#fig_32">32</a>).
The distance between the point of starting and rising
will be 100 yd. or more and will occupy from
5 to 10 sec. depending on the wind.</p>

<p>The change from flying position to climbing position
is only a slight modification involving only a
slight pulling back of the control lever and holding
it in fixed position; the motor may in some machines
simply be opened out when its increased power will
make the machine rise; however, there is only one
speed at which the climb will be fastest and therefore
it is well to know what is the proper speed
for climbing; the motor is then opened out full
and the airplane operated to give the proper speed
corresponding.</p>

<p>The pupil should rise to the height of at least 100
ft., as any less is useless and nothing will be learned
from landing. In the case of cross-country flying
the pilot will rise to the height of 2000 ft., circling
over the field rather than flying off in a straight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
line so that preparatory to his start he always has
the flying field in reach.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">Note that its attitude relative to line of flight is similar to “flying position,”
line of flight however being inclined.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><b>Landing.</b>—Proper landing is the most important
thing in airplane flying. The pilot in turning his
machine downward toward a landing spot from
flight will choose a distance from the field equivalent
to the proper gliding angle of his machine. If the
gliding angle is 1 in 7 he must not turn downward
any further from the field than a distance greater
than seven times his altitude or he will fall short.
It is safer to come closer to the field before turning
downward for two reasons: first, because you may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
not be gliding at the best gliding angle; second,
because you can always kill extra height by a spiral
or two better than you can regain it. Have height
to spare when landing.</p>

<p>To come down throttle down the engine and push
the lever softly forward until the proper gliding angle
is obtained (Fig. <a href="#fig_33">33</a>). The reason for throttling
down the engine is: first, that you do not need its
thrust when you are coasting down because gravity
furnishes all the necessary velocity; second, if you
glide or dive with the motor wide open high speed
will result, resulting in strains on the machine especially
on the moment of leveling out again; third,
at this high speed the controls become stiff to
operate.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_34" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig_34.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span>—Attitudes of an airplane in flight.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Maintain the proper gliding speed to within 5
miles an hour of what it ought to be as it is the speed
which determines the proper gliding angle. The
revolution counter will indicate what the speed is
or the air-speed meter may be used. Arrange to
come on to the field facing directly into the wind,
which may be observed by watching smoke or
flags below. In landing against the wind you are
again copying the practice of the birds. When you
come to within 15 ft. of the ground pull the lever
softly back until the machine is in its slow-flying
position, which should be attained 5 ft. above the
ground (Fig. <a href="#fig_34">34</a>). Hold the stick at this position of
horizontal flying; no further movement of the lever
is necessary except to correct bumps, for which
purpose it would be held lightly for instant action.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>The aileron control must be used here to keep the
machine level and it may be necessary to operate
the rudder after touching the ground in order to
avoid swerving; in fact some machines are provided
with a rear skid which steers for this purpose.</p>

<p>In rolling just after landing keep the tail as close
to the ground as possible without causing undue
bumping, so that the maximum resistance of the
wings may be presented to the air and the machine
be slowed up rapidly. Some machines are fitted
with brakes on the wheels to assist in the quick
retardation of the roll. Landing is one of the biggest
problems in aviation and is a hard thing to learn
because it is done at a high speed especially in the
fast military machines such as the Fokker, Nieuport,
etc. Landing is more of a problem than it
used to be in the early days when, for instance, the
Wrights were able to land without any wheels at
all on mere skids because their machines were not
fast.</p>

<p>The following are examples of bad landings:</p>

<p>1. The pancake results from allowing the machine
to get into its rising position when it is landing
(Fig. <a href="#fig_35">35</a>). There will be a perpendicular bounce
and on the second bounce the running gear will
break. In order to get out of an imminent pancake
open up the engine to keep machine flying,
put the machine into a flying position, then throttle
down again and land.</p>

<p>2. Another type of pancake results from bringing
the machine out of its gliding position at a point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
too far above the ground when the machine will
drop due to lack of speed and break the running
gear. To avoid this open motor full, thus regaining
speed and flying position; afterward throttle down
and reland.</p>
<br>

<p class="fs90">Line of flight is downward; angle of incidence large, hence speed is slow; but
there is too much downward momentum and landing gear will break. Should

position.
</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>3. A third type of bad landing results from failure
to turn the machine out of its glide at all, so that it
glides straight downward until it touches the ground.
This is the most dangerous case of all the bad landings.
To cure it open up the engine after the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
bounce, regaining flying speed before the second
bounce; then reland.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>4. If at the moment of landing the rudder is
turned causing machine to swerve, or if the machine
is not level, a side strain will be placed upon the
landing gear and the wheels will buckle (Fig. <a href="#fig_36">36</a>).</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br>
<span class="bold">CROSS-COUNTRY FLYING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Cross-country flying differs from ordinary airdrome
flying in that it takes you a long way off from
your landing field. On the airdrome your chief
anxiety is to learn how to fly, how to work the
controls, how to bank; but in cross-country work,
you are supposed to have all the technique of airplane
operation well in hand, so that you do not
have to think much about it. In cross-country
flying, then, your chief anxiety will be to arrive
at your destination and to be constantly searching
out available landing fields in case of engine failure.
The first cross-country flight you make may be a
short, easy one, in which there are plenty of available
landing places, and on which you will be able
to make a regular reconnaissance report. Further
experience in cross-country work will involve more
and more difficult trips, until you will think nothing
of flying, for example, on long raiding tours over
unfamiliar enemy country.</p>

<p><b>Equipment.</b>—Knowing that you may have to land
far away from any headquarters, you must take a
complete set of tools and covers for the airplane.
Your clothing need not be different from usual, and
will comprise helmet, goggles, leather suit, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
gloves. Do not forget your handkerchief, which
you frequently need to clean off your goggles.</p>

<p>The instruments needed on a cross-country trip
are: a compass, which should be properly adjusted
before starting and the variation angle noted.
A wrist watch is necessary; ordinary dashboard
clocks go wrong on account of the vibration.
Take an aneroid barometer with adjustable height
reading. Of course you will depend upon a revolution
indicator, for no matter how experienced a
pilot may be in “listening out” faulty engine
operation, after a long flight his ear loses its acuteness,
and he will fall back on the revolution indicator
for assistance. The air-speed meter, whether
of the Pitot type or pressure-plate type, will prove
invaluable in flying through clouds or mist when the
ground is obscured. Also the inclinometer is
able to give the angle of flight when the earth is
not visible, although the speed indicator usually is
sufficient to give the angle of flight, for an increase
of speed means downward motion and decrease of
speed means upward motion. Additional instruments
may be used.</p>

<p><b>Map.</b>—The map is essential for cross-country
work. It should be tacked on to the map board if
the flight is short, but made to run on rollers if the
flight is long. In the latter case the map is in the
form of a single long strip, while your flight may be
full of angles; therefore you will have to practice
using this sort of map, in which the corners of
your flight are all drawn as straight lines. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
scale of maps may be 2 or 4 miles to the inch for
long flights. This scale is sometimes spoken of
as a fractional figure; that is, 2 miles to the inch is
the same as <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>127,000</sub></span> scale. The map should be
studied most carefully before the start of the trip.
The course which you propose to fly should be
marked out on it; all available landmarks which
could be of service as guides should be distinctly
noticed and marked on the map where necessary.
These landmarks will in case there is no wind enable
you to make your trip without using the compass at
all, and in case of wind, are essential as a check on
the compass. Mark off the distance in miles between
consecutive points of your course. Mark the
compass bearing of each leg of this course.</p>

<p>As landmarks towns are the best guides, and they
should be underscored on the map, or enclosed in
circles. It is customary not to fly actually over
towns. Railways are very good assistance to finding
your way, and these should be marked on the
map in black wherever they approach within 10
miles of the course. Mark water courses with blue
color, and roads with red.</p>

<p><b>Landmarks.</b>—Only practice can make a pilot
good at observing the various features of the ground
beneath him. The various features which can be
used as guides are those which are most visible.
After towns, railways come next in importance.
Their bridges, tunnels, etc., make good landmarks.
On windy days when relying on the compass, it will
be well to keep in sight of a railway even if this be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
the longer way around, because the railway gives a
constant check upon the compass bearing. In this
case you will have noted on your map a general
magnetic bearing of the railway, which bearing you
can readily compare with your compass reading.
Moreover, the railway is good in case you become
involved in a fog or mist for a time. It should be
remembered, however, that on most of the maps no
distinction is made between one and two-track
roads; also that it is easy to make mistakes where
branch lines are not shown on the map because they
are dead ends leading to private quarries, etc., and
may be taken for junctions. Railways sometimes
seem to end abruptly, which means that you are
looking at a tunnel.</p>

<p>Water is visible from a great distance. Cautions
to be observed are that after a heavy rain small
flooded streams may take on the appearance of
larger bodies of water or lakes, which you will have
difficulty in reconciling with the map. Small rivers
are often overhung with foliage, and to follow them
in all their curves will waste a lot of time.</p>

<p>The use of roads as guides may be governed by
the fact that paved roads are usually main roads,
and telegraph wires may be expected along them.
In the newer parts of the United States the system
of laying out roads provides a very useful means
of gaging distances; I refer to the section system
which is in use, for instance, in Illinois, where there
is a road every mile running north and south, so
that the entire country is cut up into squares 1<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
mile on each side, with occasional roads of course at
½-mile and ¼-mile points.</p>

<p><b>Navigation by Landmarks.</b>—In all cases of cross-country
flying the pilot will have two independent
systems of maintaining his proper directions: first,
the computed compass bearing; second, the use of
landmarks whose position is known. In comparing
his computed course with the course actually indicated
by passing over these landmarks the rule
should be made that, in case of doubt when a landmark
is not distinctly recognized, take the compass
course; there are many chances that a landmark
may be altered or even removed without being so
recorded on the pilot’s map, whereas the errors of
the compass of course are presumably understood
by the pilot who has secured every opportunity to
check it when passing previous landmarks.</p>

<p>It is important to note the time of completing
successive stages of the flight, that is when passing
over predetermined landmarks. Time is a very
uncertain condition to ascertain in airplane flying
for it seems to pass quickly on calm days but slowly
when the journey is rough. If the pilot does not
check the time interval between successive objects
he is quite likely to expect the next before it is really
due.</p>

<p><b>Landing Fields.</b>—Next to the ever-present worry
which the pilot has regarding the perfect operation
of his engine, the most important thing about cross-country
flying is that wherever he may be he must
have available a landing field within gliding distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
in case his engine defaults. The question is of
course immediately raised, “What if there is no
landing field within gliding range?” The answer
to this is that the pilot will instinctively learn to
keep his eyes open for landing possibilities every
minute of his progress whether he expects to use
them or not; in cross-country flying the lookout for
fields is first and foremost in his mind; if there are
no fields, it is up to him to pick out a spot of ground
which is the least objectionable for a landing. In
the State of Illinois the question of landing fields is
almost non-existent, because there are large, flat
fields and pastures in almost every square mile of
the farming district, and a cross-country flight from
Rantoul to Chicago could have no terrors for the
beginner as regards the choice of a landing ground.</p>

<p>When it comes to a cross-country flight like
Ruth Law’s, from Chicago to New York, these
favorable conditions begin to disappear after the
middle of the journey, that is, east of Buffalo. The
most ideal condition for cross-country flying would
be one like that on the London-Edinburgh route,
where landing grounds are so frequent that by flying
at a height of a couple of miles the pilot can free his
mind completely of the worry of suitable landing
places; but in the United States we have very few
established airdromes, and the only approach to
the London-Edinburgh route is the St. Louis-New
York route, where the jumps are approximately
150 miles; namely, St. Louis, Champaign, Indianapolis,
Dayton, Sandusky, Erie, Hammondsport,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
Philadelphia, and New York. That is why long
cross-country trips are such an adventure in this
country and such an ordinary affair in England.</p>

<p>The beginner will have special difficulty in training
his mind to pick out available landing places;
first of all because the earth looks so different from
the sky that it is only with practice a beginner learns
the shades and hues of color which mean certain
kinds of ground, or learns to spot the different features
of flat and hilly country. Even for an accomplished
pilot it is hard to tell whether a field
is good or bad from a height of over 1000 ft.; and as
it is dangerous to fly this low over unknown territory,
you can at once see what is meant by the
worry of scanning the countryside for available
fields.</p>

<p>Choose the best field that you can get, having a
smooth surface and being easy to get out of in all
directions. The following considerations are intended
as a guide to what constitute the best
field, in case you have a choice between several
possibilities.</p>

<p>1. Choose a field near a town if possible, or failing
that, near a main road or at least a good road.
Remember that a field which appears to be near a
town from the air may actually turn out to be a long
walk after you have landed there and find that there
are various trips to be made to and fro between your
chosen landing spot and the town for the purpose of
securing ropes, gasoline, supplies, etc. If you land
near a main road there will probably be telegraph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
wires along it, which are undesirable in the case of a
small field and wind direction such that you have
to rise off the field over the telegraph wires. It is
often hard to distinguish between main roads and
minor roads, and it will be wise to look for the number
of vehicles on any road in determining whether
or not it is the main road.</p>

<p>2. The best field is a stubble field, and is most
numerous of course in the fall when the crops are in.
It will have a lightish brown color when seen from a
height, and is pretty sure to be smooth, without
ditches or mounds. Grass land is next best, but is
often full of mounds. Plowed, furrow fields are to
be avoided. It might be said that stubble fields
will be hard to get out of after a wet night. Vegetable
and corn fields have a dark green appearance
which the pilot must learn to distinguish from grass
pastures, etc. If you choose pasture land, remember
that in summer evenings the farm animals will
generally be lying down near the hedges.</p>

<p>3. Avoid river valleys for landing over night, as
there is liable to be a fog in the morning.</p>

<p>4. Any field which has been previously used for
landing with success by an army officer can be
wisely chosen.</p>

<p>The final determination of landing field characteristics
can be made when your airplane has descended
to a height of 1000 ft. off the ground, and in case
you are not making a forced landing and your engine
is still going, you can check up your estimate by
descending to this level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p><b>Proper Dimensions of Fields and Airdromes.</b>—There
are three kinds of flying fields. One is the
airdrome which is used exclusively for flying, and
may be as large as a mile square; very few of these
will be found in cross-country flights in the United
States. Second, there is what is called the “one-way”
field, a long, narrow, open space which is usable
when the wind blows parallel to its length.
Third, there is the “two-way” field, which has two
sufficiently long runways at right angles to each
other. A two-way field is very much better than a
one-way field, inasmuch as you can always head
within 45° of the wind, whereas in a one-way field
an extreme case would be 90°. Moreover, two-way
fields, such as the crescent-shaped field at Dayton,
Ohio, sometimes permit of almost universal direction
of flight. The two-way field may be crescent-shaped,
T-shaped, or L-shaped. An L-shaped field
should have each arm 200 by 300 yd. Under certain
conditions there may be buildings located inside
or outside the angle which do no harm aside
from creating eddies in case of strong wind. A
T-shaped field should also have its arms 300 by 200
yd. in size.</p>

<p>Regarding the size of fields it can be said that,
while the JN-4 machine will rise off the ground
after a run of 100 yd. or so, a field of this length
is of course not big enough for frequent use,
especially if bordered by trees, telegraph lines,
fences, and so forth. A field for temporary use
should be at least 200 by 200 yd., about 9 acres.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
If obstructions at the edges are more than 5 ft. high
add to this 200 yd. a distance equal to twelve times
the height of the obstruction. For a permanent
field 300 yd. is the minimum dimension necessary
for clearing obstacles and must be increased if the
trees exceed 50 ft. in height. This minimum dimension
assumes hard ground and the possibility of
starting in any direction. Training fields are ½
mile square or more.</p>

<p>Whatever field is used either temporarily or
permanently by the pilot should be absolutely
familiar to him over every inch of its surface. The
adjacent country should also be absolutely familiar
to him from the standpoint of possible forced landings
which he may have to make during his flight;
he should make a habit of informing himself as to all
the woods and hills, etc., which can affect air currents
in the neighborhood of the field from which he is
going to start.</p>

<p><b>Guide Posts on Airdromes.</b>—Some fields have
pot holes in them, and these holes should be marked
in each case with a large high red or yellow flag.
Do not use short, small flags, as they will frequently
be invisible to pilots taxying on the ground. All
telephone wires, etc., should have large blankets or
other suitable signals hung over them to warn the
pilot away.</p>

<p>Commonly accepted marks for designating a landing
spot on airdromes are as follows:</p>

<p>For day use a large letter “T” lying on the
ground, made out of white cloth strips 15 by 3 ft.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
This letter T is shifted with the wind so that its
long leg always points in the direction of the
wind and the pilot will therefore have nothing to do
in landing but approach the letter “T” from the
bottom, so to speak.</p>

<p>For night flying a system of four flares is used, so
arranged that the pilot in making a proper landing
will pass flare A on his left; within 50 yd. further
on, flare B; then 100 yd. further on, flare C, also on
his left. In passing flare C he will have a fourth
flare, D, 50 yd. to his right. That is to say, the
four flares make the outline of a letter “L” and the
pilot approaches the letter having the long leg
on his left. The flares may be made by putting
half a gallon of gasoline into a pail. This will
burn for 30 min. and will be visible 8 miles away.
Sometimes at night instead of flares white sheets
can be spread on the ground and a shaded lamp used
to illuminate the sheets.</p>

<p>All searchlights on the landing field should point
in the direction of landing. All other lights within
a distance of a mile should be extinguished, and red
lamps should be used at danger points.</p>

<p>On moonlight nights the same signals and guides
may be used as in the daytime.</p>

<p><b>Pegging Down an Airplane.</b>—In landing for the
night do not stay up until it gets dark but choose a
landing place which will allow you to come down 1 hr.
before dark; this amount of time will be needed for
laying up the machine over night. As you come to
the landing ground note the time so that you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
compute the actual duration of your flight in your
report, then make a good landing. Taxy the
machine to the spot where you intend to leave it
over night, such as the lee of a hedge, etc.; or if
there is no choice of position taxy the machine to
the approximate location from which you will make
your start next morning; this will save trouble when
you get ready to start.</p>

<p>Dismount from your machine, lift up the tail
enough to leave the wings edgewise to the wind, the
machine, of course, facing the wind, and jack up the
tail in this position by the use of any convenient
prop. Lash the control wheel or joy stick fast in a
fixed position so that the wind can not flap the control
surfaces around and damage them.</p>

<p>Choose a sunken trench if possible in which the
wheels may be sunk; if the wind is going to blow and
there is no sunken trench it will be wise to dig one
so that the effect of the wind on the airplane will be
lessened. If the trench is not necessary, at least
put chocks under the wheels. Peg down the wings
and the tail to stakes driven into the ground using
rope if you can get some or lacking this in an
emergency fence wires which you can secure by
means of your wire cutters. Do not lash tightly
enough to induce strains in the framework of the
machine.</p>

<p>Next, fill up the tanks if a supply of gasoline or
oil is available. Put the covers on the propellers,
engine, cowls, etc., in order that rain and dew
shall do no damage to these parts. The wings and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
body are varnished waterproof and will not be
seriously damaged by a little moisture; to avoid
the collection of moisture in the wings small eyelet
holes are sometimes set in the wings at the trailing
edge to let out the water.</p>

<p>Of course, you will engage a guard to watch the
machine all night; see that a rope is strung around
the airplane to keep off the crowd which may collect.</p>


<h3>AERIAL NAVIGATION</h3>

<p><b>Effect of Wind.</b>—Navigating in an airplane is
complicated only on account of the fact that there
is a wind blowing which may not be in the desired
direction. While on the sea navigation is simple
through the assistance of the magnetic compass
(because side winds can not materially drift the
ship sideways), in the air this is not the case; for if
the pilot using the compass points the nose of the
airplane directly north while a west wind is blowing,
this wind will cause the machine to drift in an
easterly direction so that in an hour of flight the airplane
will be off its course by an amount equal to
distance which the wind travels in 1 hr.; and the
joint result of the motion of the airplane forward
and the motion of the wind sideways will cause the
machine to drift in a northeasterly direction at a
speed quite different from its rated velocity, and in
this case somewhat larger. Victor Carlstrom in his
Chicago-New York flight found while he was over
Cleveland that a side wind was deviating his course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
17° away from what it should be, and if he had not
had such landmarks as the shore of Lake Erie for
guidance he might easily have lost considerable
time.</p>

<p>The question of making allowance for this wind
drift is very important where there are no landmarks,
as in the case of night flying, flying over the
sea, or flying over the clouds; and the only way the
pilot can make allowances for these conditions is to
figure them out before he starts from the airdrome,
and plan to circumvent them. That is to say, the
pilot in flight has no means, aside from visual
observation of the ground, to determine whether or
not the wind is blowing him off his course. He must
determine the whole situation before he starts, and
the process of doing so is as follows.</p>

<p><b>Graphical Method for Determining Direction to
Steer.</b>—The pilot will ascertain from the weather
vane and anemometer of the airdrome (1) the
velocity and (2) the direction of the wind, (3) the
speed of the airplane he is to fly, (4) the compass
bearing of the actual course which he desires to
follow. With this data it is possible to construct a
simple diagram and to determine the direction to be
steered and the actual velocity which will result in
the proposed journey. A draftsman’s scale, protractor
and dividers, a pencil and a piece of paper are
the necessary equipment.</p>

<p>When the wind blows at an angle with the desired
course it is necessary to steer the airplane in such a
direction that its own forward motion will neutralizer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
the side effect of the drift of the wind from moment
to moment. The problem is to determine this
direction for steering, as it is not known. We are
not concerned with distances in this problem, for
the direction is going to be the same whether our
flight is of 100 or 200 miles. We are, however,
vitally concerned with velocities; and we will assume
that the velocity of the airplane is known to be
75 miles per hour, and from observation on a
local anemometer the velocity of the wind is known
to be 20 miles an hour. We also know, of course,
the direction of the wind, which should be given in
terms of an angle whose other leg points directly
north. Now if the flight is to be made at a height
of 2000 ft., as is usual in cross-country flight over
average country, we will find that the speed of wind
will increase as we rise up; moreover, that its direction
will change. In the present case the wind will
be 88 per cent. higher in 2000 ft. than it is on the
ground; that is to say, the velocity at the altitude
we are going to use is twenty times 1.88, or about
38 miles per hour. Moreover, as the height increases
the direction of the wind changes, shifting
around always in a clockwise direction as the height
increases, in the present case shifting around 16°
from its ground direction. (The change of velocity
and direction for various heights is indicated on the
subjoined table.) Thus a west wind becomes at a
height of 2000 ft. a slightly northwest wind, or, to
be exact, blows from a direction which is 74° west
of north.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>Our treatment of the problem then has for starting
points: velocity of wind, 38 miles per hour;
direction of the wind, 74° west of north; velocity of
airplane 75 miles per hour; desired direction of
flight (which has been determined by laying out on
the map and reading the compass bearing with the
protractor), say 60° east of north. In 1 hr. of
flight the machine would travel in this unknown
direction a distance of 75 miles were it not for the
wind, but for every hour of such flying the wind is
blowing it 38 miles sideways; and the desired direction
must be such that its joint effect, together
with the 38 mile sideways wind, will leave the
machine exactly on its proper course at the end of
the hour.</p>

<p>On the map or piece of paper denote the starting
point by <em>A</em> (see Fig. <a href="#fig_37">37</a>). From <em>A</em> draw a
line parallel to the wind (that is to say, 74° west
of north), and let this line represent, to any convenient
scale, the speed of the wind, 38 miles per
hour. The far end of the line may be called <em>B</em>, and
may be given an arrow to represent the direction
of wind. Now draw on the map a line from <em>A</em> to
the desired destination (<em>C</em>), giving it, of course the
proper compass bearing. Take the dividers, and
with <em>B</em> as a center, describe an arc at such distance
as to represent 75 miles per hour, the speed of the
machine; this arc will intercept the line <em>AC</em> at <em>D</em>,
and <em>BD</em> then gives the direction to steer, for it is
that direction which will permit the airplane in 1
hour exactly to neutralize the sidewise drift of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
wind. The distance <em>AD</em> on this diagram can be
measured off and will give the actual velocity of
movement along the line of flight in miles per hour.
Notice that it is 97 miles per hour, quite different
from the speed of the airplane.</p>

counteract wind-drift.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Assuming that the pilot has determined the proper
angle toward which the airplane nose must be
pointed, has maintained this angle throughout his
flight by means of the compass and has safely
reached his objective; for the return trip this diagram
must be completely reconstructed (unless the
wind is exactly parallel to his course). The pilot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
should not make the mistake in returning to the
starting point of steering the airplane nose in a
direction exactly opposite to the outward trip; the
reader may make this clear to himself by drawing
the return diagram and comparing it with the outward-bound
diagram.</p>

<p>To summarize flying when a cross wind is blowing,
it will be said that the direction of actual
travel will not be the direction indicated by the axis
of the airplane; and that therefore while in a picture
of the situation the airplane appears to skid
sideways along the whole course it must be borne
in mind that actually there is no skidding whatever
but the air is meeting the airplane in normal manner.
The situation is analogous to that of a fly
going from one side to the other of the cabin of a
moving ship, where the actual course through space
of the fly is an apparent skid, due to the resultant of
its own and the ship’s movement.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Wind on Radius of Action.</b>—Not only
is the direction of flight altered by the wind but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
also the radius of action from a standpoint of gasoline
capacity is altered. In the above machine the
gasoline capacity is sufficient for 3½ hr. of flight.
How far can it go across country and return before
the gasoline is used up? Always allow ½ hr.
gasoline for climbing and for margin; this leaves
3 hr., which at 75 miles an hour is 225 miles, or
112 miles out and 112 miles back. Now suppose
that a flight is to be made across country directly
in the teeth of a 40-mile wind; the radius of flight
will be altered as indicated by the following calculation:
Speed outward is obviously 75 minus 40
or 35 miles per hour. Speed on the return trip is
obviously 75 plus 40 or 115 miles per hour—3.29
times as fast—and occupying a time which may
be designated by the letter <em>x</em>. The time on the
outward trip may be designated by 3.29<em>x</em>, a
total time of <em>x</em> + 3.29<em>x</em> which we know equals 180
min. before the gas runs out. Solve the equation
<em>x</em> + 3.29<em>x</em> = 180 and we find that <em>x</em> is equal to 42
min., that is, the return trip requires 42 min., and
the outward trip requires 138 min. The distance
covered on the outward trip is then <span class="xs"><sup>138</sup>/<sub>60</sub></span> of 35,
which equals 80.5 miles. The radius is then
reduced from 112 miles to 80.5 miles.</p>

<p>In cases where the wind is not parallel to the
line of flight the actual velocity of course can not
be obtained by adding up the airplane and wind
velocities, but must be obtained by the graphical
method mentioned above; thenceforward the
calculation is the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p><b>Effect of Height.</b>—Of course if one has to fly in the
teeth of a wind and can choose one’s own altitude,
it is desirable to fly low where the head wind has
its smaller velocity, and when flying with the following
wind to rise to considerable altitudes. The
proper height at which to fly will be about 1500
to 3000 ft., for cross-country trips over ordinary
country; but may be increased when the wind is
unsteady or decreased when there are low-lying
clouds. The steadiness as well as the speed of the
wind increases with the height. The character of
the country should be carefully investigated from
the profile maps before starting; all hilly parts
should be marked on the map as a warning against
landing. Contour is not readily distinguished from
a height of 2000 ft. and for this reason points may
be indicated on the map where poor landing places
make it desirable to fly high. The character of the
country or the scarcity of landing places may make
it advisable to fly at high altitudes for the following
reasons: (1) in case of engine failure a good
margin of height is necessary to provide length of
glide to reach distant landing places; (2) there is
then plenty of space for righting the airplane in
case of bumps, side slips, etc.; (3) eddies or local
currents due to inequalities of the ground do not
exist to great heights; (4) landmarks can be better
distinguished from high altitudes because the vision
is better (however, one must never trust to landmarks
only in navigating but should constantly
use a compass if only as a check, and especially in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
passing through clouds). Having selected in advance
the proper height to use during the trip
climb to this height in circles; note the direction of
wind drift meanwhile to check up your estimate.
Pass directly over the point of departure and when
over it point the nose of the airplane for a moment
directly toward the desired objective (which can
be done with the aid of the magnetic compass);
select some distant object which is dead ahead, and
therefore directly in the course; then head the nose
of the machine up into the wind just enough so that
the direction of movement will be straight toward
this distant object. The direction of the nose of the
machine thus set by a method distinct from the
graphical method above mentioned should exactly
correspond, however, with the calculated direction;
and thus a means of checking is obtained.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Fog.</b>—The effect of fog upon navigating
an airplane is that it prevents the use of landmarks
in aiding the pilot; also that it upsets the pilot’s
sense of level. These two effects are, of course,
independent of the fact that proper landing places
are obscured, with resultant peril in case of engine
failure. Therefore, a fog should be avoided whenever
possible; when one comes up, the airplane
should descend, and should never attempt to get
above it, as in certain localities it may turn out to
be a ground fog. If the fog is very bad, land at the
earliest opportunity. It is on account of fog that
the pilot avoids river valleys where frequently there
is a haze from the ground up to a height of 700 ft.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
preventing the view of proper landing places in case
of necessity.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Clouds on Navigation.</b>—Flying in or
above the clouds is a similar case, inasmuch as
landmarks can not be seen. It is not wise to go
above the clouds when on the sea coast, as offshore
winds may, unknown to the pilot, carry him out
to sea; and any flight over the sea which is to a
distance greater than the safe return gliding distance
is, of course, perilous.</p>

<p><b>Navigation by Means of the Drift Indicator.</b>—The
drift indicator is an instrument for determining
directly the side drift of an airplane. It enables
the pilot by looking through a telescope at the
ground to determine exactly what his direction of
motion is with relation to the ground. The telescope
is mounted vertically and is rotatable about
its own axis; it has a cross-hair which appears in the
field of view during the pilot’s observation of the
ground. As the airplane speeds overhead objects
on the ground will appear through the telescope to
slip backward in the given direction; and when accustomed
to the use of this instrument the pilot
can rotate the telescope until the cross-hair is
exactly parallel to the apparent line of motion of
objects on the ground. The telescope cross-hair
is parallel to the axis of the airplane normally and
the scale attached to the telescope will in this case
read zero. When the pilot rotates the telescope so
that the cross-hair becomes parallel to the relative
backward motion of the ground the scale will read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
something different from zero and will give the angle
between the actual line of motion and the axis of the
airplane.</p>

<p>Such a drift indicator is, of course, useful only when
the ground is visible. The pilot knowing the angle
between the airplane axis and the line of motion
and therefore knowing the deviation between the
supposed course and the actual course is able to
make corrections and steer the machine in its proper
direction. This may be done by altering the
“lubber-line” or his compass just enough to offset
the side drift of the machine; after which the desired
course may be followed by simply keeping to the
proper compass bearing. An instrument has been
devised wherein the rotation of the drift-indicator
telescope simultaneously alters the lubber-line zero.
The operator then has merely to take an occasional
observation of the apparent drift line of the ground,
which observation automatically shifts the lubber-line
and navigation proceeds as if there were no side
wind blowing whatever. Knowing the angle between
the direction of movement and the airplane
axis, the pilot may then compute the speed of motion
in a manner analogous to the graphical method
previously mentioned; or he can make use of a chart
for the determination of this speed.</p>

<p><b>Navigation over Water.</b>—In flying over water the
presence of waves is a valuable guide to the aviator,
for he knows that these waves extend in a direction
normal to the wind. Moreover, he knows that the
velocity of the waves bears some relation to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
velocity of the wind. In order to estimate the velocity
of the waves it is only necessary to know their
wave length, that is, the distance between two consecutive
wave crests. The rule is that for a wave
length of 10 ft. the velocity is 10 miles per hour, and
will vary as the square root of this wave length;
that is, if the wave length is half, the velocity will
be 10 divided by the square root of 2, or 7.1 miles
per hour.</p>

<span class="bold">THE RIGGING OF AIRPLANES</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Object.</b>—The object of this chapter is to teach
the elementary principles of correct rigging. It is
not expected that the student will become an expert
mechanic, but with this treatment as a basis and
through practice he will be able to judge whether
or not a machine is correctly and safely rigged.
In other words, he will not have to depend on someone
else’s judgment as to whether panels, wires,
controls, struts, etc., of a machine are in good order,
but he will be able to observe understandingly that
they are. If the engine goes wrong he can land, if
the rigging goes wrong he is in great difficulty.
Moreover, if the rigging is wrong, speed is lessened
and the stability is uncertain.</p>

<p>The first thing to be learned in rigging is a knowledge
of the peculiar terms which have come into
use in aeronautics defining different parts of the
machines. Our present list of terms is derived,
partly from French, partly from English, and
partly from American terms. Thus different names
may refer to the same part.</p>


<h3>NOMENCLATURE</h3>

the machine is called a pusher.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>3. Fuselage</b> or <b>Body</b>.—The main body of the airplane in
which the pilot sits and to which the landing gear, motor,
controls, and sustaining surfaces are fixed. A small body,

a false piece that it may have a stream-line body.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>7. Wings, Planes, Panels.</b>—The main supporting surfaces
of an airplane are called wings, although the terms planes and
panels are probably as frequently used and even preferred by
many. The term panel refers properly to a section of the
wings with the included struts and wires. The small panel
directly above the body is called the engine section panel or
the center panel, while the panels to the right and left of
the body or fuselage are called the main panels. The main

Each main panel may be subdivided into the inner wing bay,
the outer wing bay, and the overhang.</p>

wires which support the weight of the panels when landing or
on the ground.</p>

which support the body or fuselage from the planes when in
flight.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>18. Drift Wires.</b>—The horizontal wires which lead from the

to which the control wires are attached.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>22. Struts; Wing Struts.</b>—The vertical members of the wing
trusses of a biplane, used to take pressure or compression,
whereas the wires of the trusses are used to take pull or tension.
There are also fuselage struts and chassis struts.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>23. Spar or Wing Bars.</b>—The longitudinal members of the
interior wing framework.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p class="fs90"><b>27. Propeller.</b>—</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>28. Pitch (Propeller).</b>—The distance forward that the
propeller would travel in one revolution, if there were no slip,
that is, if it were moving in a thread cut at the same inclination
as the blade. Pitch angle refers to the angle of inclination
of the propeller blade.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>29. Slip.</b>—Slip is the difference between the actual travel
forward of a screw propeller in one revolution and its pitch.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>30. Dope.</b>—A general term applied to the material used in
treating the cloth surface of airplane members to increase
strength, produce tautness, and act as a filler to maintain air
and moisture tightness. Usually of the cellulose type.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>31. Controls.</b>—Since there are three axes or main directions
about which an airplane may turn or rotate it follows
that three controlling devices are required. These are: (1) the
elevator for pitching; (2) the rudder for steering or yawing;
(3) the ailerons for lateral, rolling or banking control.</p>

<p class="fs90">The term controls is a general term used to distinguish the
means provided for operating the devices used to control
speed, direction of flight and attitude of the aircraft.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>32. Cotter Pins.</b>—Must be on every nut.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>33. Castelled Nuts.</b>—Admit cotter pins.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>34. Turnbuckles.</b>—Must be well and evenly threaded and
locked with safety wires.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>35. Safety Wires.</b>—For locking turnbuckles and hinge pins.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>36. Shackle and Pin.</b>—</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>37. Hinge Connections.</b>—</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>38. Leading Edge or Entering Edge.</b>—The front edge of a
plane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p class="fs90"><b>39. Trailing Edge.</b>—The rear edge of a plane.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>40. Stagger.</b>—The horizontal distance that the entering
edge of the upper wing of a biplane is ahead of the entering
edge of the lower wing.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>41. Dihedral Angle.</b>—A term used to denote that the wings
are arranged to incline slightly upward from the body toward
their tips. The angle made with the horizontal by this inclination
of the wing is called the dihedral angle.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>42. Angle of Incidence.</b>—The angle at which a wing is inclined
to the line of flight.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>43. Decalage.</b>—Difference in angle of incidence between
any two distinct aerofoils on an airplane.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>44. Chord.</b>—Distance between the entering edge and trailing
edge of a wing measured on a straight line touching front
and rear bottom points of a wing.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>45. Camber.</b>—The depth of the curve given to a sustaining
surface such as a wing. Thus it will be observed that the
planes are not straight in cross-section but are concave slightly
upward. The depth of this concavity is the camber. Another
way of expressing this is that camber is the greatest distance
between the surface of a wing and its chord line.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>46. Gap.</b>—The distance between the lower and upper wings
of a biplane.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>47. Spread.</b>—The distance over all from one wing tip to the
other wing tip.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>48. Aerofoil.</b>—A general name applied to any wing or lifting
surface of an airplane.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>49. Deadhead Resistance.</b>—Each part of an airplane
against which the wind strikes offers a resistance against being
moved through the air. This is called the <em>deadhead resistance</em>
or the <em>parasite resistance</em>. It is for the purpose of lessening
this resistance that the parts of a machine are stream-lined.
Remember that force or power must be applied to overcome
this resistance and the lessening of such resistance decreases
the power necessary. A parallel illustration is to think of the
power necessary to push a board sideways through water.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>50. Drift.</b>—When the air strikes the inclined wing of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
airplane its force has two components. One part called the
<em>lift</em> (see 52) acts up and tends to lift the machine. The other
part, called <em>drift</em>, tends to push the machine backward. This
drift must also be overcome by applying power enough to
drive the machine forward.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>51. Total Resistance.</b>—Sometimes called <em>drag</em>. (49) Deadhead
resistance added to (50) drift, gives the total forces opposing
the forward movement of the airplane. This is called the
total resistance and is overcome by the <em>thrust</em> of the propeller.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>52. Lift.</b>—(See 50). The upward or vertical part of the air
pressure acting against the wings, and which is utilized to lift
or support the airplane.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>53. Center of Gravity.</b>—The point of balance of an airplane
which may be otherwise defined as the point through which the
mass of an airplane acts. If the weight is too far forward the
machine is nose-heavy. If the weight is too far behind the
center of lift the machine is tail-heavy.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>54. Aspect Ratio.</b>—The ratio of span to chord of a wing or
any other aerofoil.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>55. Gliding Angle (Volplane).</b>—The angle made to the horizontal
by the flight path of an airplane with the engine shut
off; <em>e.g.</em>, an airplane is 1000 ft. high, when its engine fails.
Suppose its gliding angle is 1 in 6. Therefore, in still air it
can glide 6000 ft. forward. The general term glide refers to
flying without power.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>56. The Angle of Best Climb.</b>—The steepest angle at which
an airplane can climb.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>57. Stability.</b>—The property of an airplane to maintain its
direction and to return easily to its equilibrium or balance with
a minimum of oscillation. This is sometimes called dynamical
stability. An airplane may have (first) inherent stability,
which is the stability due to the arrangement and disposition
of its fixed parts. It may also have stability with regard to
any one of the three directions in which it may move. These
are named as follows: (1) directional stability, with reference
to the vertical axis; (2) lateral stability with reference to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
longitudinal (or fore and aft) axis; (3) longitudinal stability,
stability with reference to the lateral (or thwartship) axis.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>58. Flying Position.</b>—Refers to the position of the fuselage
when flying. With the Curtiss JN-4 machines in this position
the top longerons are horizontal and level both ways. The
engine bearers are also level, and the wings have an angle of
incidence of 2°.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>59. Capacity.</b>—The weight an airplane will carry in excess
of the dead load (dead load includes structure power plant and
essential accessories).</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>60. Flight Path.</b>—The path of the center of gravity of an
aircraft with reference to the air.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>61. Stalling.</b>—A term describing the condition of an airplane
which from any cause has lost the relative speed necessary
for support and controlling, and referring particularly to angles
of incidence greater than the critical angle.</p>

<p class="fs90"><b>62. Sweepback.</b>—The horizontal angle (if any) that the
leading edge of a machine makes with the crosswise or lateral
axis of an airplane.</p>

<span class="bold">MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The materials of construction for airplanes should
be of such material, size and form as to combine
greatest strength and least weight. With metal
parts in particular it may be necessary to substitute
less strong material for the sake of getting non-corrosive
qualities, ability to withstand bending, ductility
or ease of bending, etc. With wood, absence
of warping is important as well. The materials
which are considered are the following: wood, steel,
including wires; special metals as aluminum, brass,
monel metal, copper, etc., and also linen and dope.</p>

<p><b>Strength of Materials.</b>—It is important in a general
way to understand the terms used in speaking
of strength of materials. Thus we may have
strength in tension, strength in compression, or
strength in shearing, bending and torsion. Some
material fitted to take tension will not take compression,
as for example wire; some material, as bolts,
are suited to take shear, etc.</p>

<p>In general all material for airplanes has been carefully
tested and no excess material is used above that
necessary to give the machine the necessary
strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p><b>Tension.</b>—This means the strength of a material
which enables it to withstand a pull. Thus wires
are used where strength of this kind is required.</p>

<p><b>Compression.</b>—This refers to strength against a
pressure. Wire has no strength for this purpose,
and wood or sometimes steel is used.</p>

<p><b>Shearing.</b>—Refers to strength against cutting off
sideways. Thus the pull on an eyebolt tends to
shear the eyebolt, or the side pull on any bolt or pin
tends to shear the pin.</p>

<p><b>Bending.</b>—In bending material the fibres on the
outside tend to pull apart; those on the inside tend
to go together. Thus on the outside we have tension,
and on the inside compression. Along the
center line there is neither tension or compression,
it is the “neutral axis.”</p>

<p><b>Torsion.</b>—Torsion is a twisting force, such as an
engine propeller shaft receives.</p>

<p><b>Testing for Strength.</b>—If a wire is an inch square
in cross-section and breaks when a load of 150,000
lb. is hung on it, we say that the strength of the
wire is 150,000 per square inch. Smaller wires
equally strong have a strength of 150,000 lb. per
square inch also, but they in themselves will not
support a load of 150,000 lb. but only the fraction
of that, according to the fraction of a square inch
represented by their cross-section.</p>

<p>In the same way, a square inch of wood under a
compressive load may break at 5000 lb. If, however,
the piece of wood is long in proportion to its
thickness, it will bend easily and support much less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
weight. For example, a perfectly straight walking
cane could perhaps have a ton weight put on it
without breaking but if the cane were not set
squarely or if it started to bend it would immediately
break under the load.</p>

<p>These cases illustrate the importance of having
struts perfectly straight, not too spindling and
evenly bedded in their sockets. Some training
machines are built with a factor of safety of 12.
That is to say, the breaking strength of any part is
twelve times the ordinary load or stress under which
the piece is placed. It should be remembered,
however, that under any unusual condition in the
air, such as banking, etc., extra strains are placed on
the parts and the factor of safety is much less than
12. Factor of safety of 12 thus does not mean
exactly what it does in other engineering work,
where allowances are made for severe conditions.
The so-called factor of safety of 12 in airplane work
is probably no greater than a factor of safety of 2 or
3 in regular engineering work.</p>

<p>There are three all-important features in the flying
machine construction, viz., lightness, strength
and extreme rigidity. Spruce is the wood generally
used for parts when lightness is desired more than
strength, oak, ash, hickory and maple are all
stronger, but they are also considerably heavier,
and where the saving of weight is essential, the
difference is largely in favor of the spruce. This
will be seen in the following condensed table of U.
S. Government Specifications.</p>

<p>A frequently asked question is: “Why is not aluminum
or some similar metal, substituted for wood?”
Wood, particularly spruce, is preferred because,
weight considered, it is much stronger than aluminum,
and this is the lightest of all metals. In
this connection the following table will be of interest.</p>

<p><b>Wood.</b>—Present practice in airplane construction
is to use wood for practically all framing, in other
words, for all parts which take pressure or compression.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
Although wood is not as strong for its
size as steel and therefore offers more air resistance
for the same strength yet the fact that frame parts
must not be too spindling, in other words, that they
must have a certain thickness in proportion to their
unsupported length, has led to the use of wood in
spite of the greater strength of steel. Some airplanes,
however, as the Sturtevant, are constructed
with practically a steel framing.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that any piece or kind
of wood will not answer for framing, and more especially
for repair parts. There is a tremendous difference
in the strength and suitability among different
woods for the work. For instance, a piece
of wood of cross or irregular grain, one with knots,
or even one which has been bored or cut or bruised
on the outside, may have only half or less the
strength of the original piece. Air drying doubles
the strength of green wood, proper oven drying is
better yet.</p>

<p>Notice how the ends of each piece are ferruled,
usually with copper or tin. This is to prevent the
bolt pulling out with the grain of the wood, and also
prevents splitting and end checking and gives a
uniform base on which the pressure comes.</p>

<p>It is generally advised not to paint wood as it
tends to conceal defects from inspection. So
varnish only.</p>

<p>Wrapping wooden members with linen or cord
tightly and doping this, both to make waterproof
and to still further tighten, increases the resistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
to splitting. The absence of warping tendencies
determine often what wood to choose.</p>

<p>The selection of lumber and detection of flaws
is a matter of experience and should be cultivated.
It is, however, nothing more than the extension
of the knowledge that leads a man to pick out a
good baseball bat.</p>

<p><b>Woods.</b>—1. <em>Spruce.</em>—Should be clear, straight-grained,
smooth and free from knot holes and sap
pockets, and carefully kiln-dried or seasoned. It
is about the lightest and for its weight the strongest
wood used. It is ordinarily used as a material
for spars, struts, landing gear, etc., as it has a
proper combination of flexibility, lightness and
strength.</p>

<p>2. <em>White Pine.</em>—A very light wood used for wing
ribs, and small struts.</p>

<p>3. <em>Ash.</em>—Springy, strong in tension, hard and
tough, but is considerably heavier than spruce.
Used for longerons, rudder post, etc.</p>

<p>4. <em>Maple.</em>—Used for small wood details, as for
blocks connecting rib pieces across a spar or for
spacers in a built-up rib.</p>

<p>5. <em>Hard Pine.</em>—Tough and uniform and recommended
for long pieces, such as the wooden braces
in the wings.</p>

<p>6. <em>Walnut, Mahogany, Quarter-sawed Oak.</em>—The
strength, uniformity, hardness and finishing qualities
make these woods favorites for propeller
construction.</p>

<p>7. <em>Cedar Wood.</em>—Is used occasionally for fuselage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
coverings or for hull planking in hydroplanes
as it is light, uniform and easily worked. Veneers,
or cross-glued thin layers of wood, are sometimes
used for coverings.</p>

<p>Laminated or built-up wooden members have
been much used for framing and for ribs and spars.
The engine bearers are always of wood on account
of vibration and are also laminated. In lamination
the wooden strut is built up of several pieces of
wood carefully glued together. The grains of the
different layers run in different directions, consequently
a stronger and more uniform stick often
is secured. The objection to laminated pieces
comes from the weather causing ungluing. Laminated
pieces should be wrapped in linen or paper
and freshened with paint or varnish from time to
time.</p>

<p><b>Forms.</b>—Attention should be called to the hollowed
form of many of the wooden members. In
any beam or strut, material at the center of the
cross-section is of far less value in taking the load
than the material away from the center. Therefore,
to secure greatest strength with least weight,
it is permissible to lighten wooden members if done
understandingly.</p>

<p><b>Steel.</b>—There is a tremendous difference in the
strength, wearing and other desirable qualities
among different steels and irons. For airplane
work none but the best qualities are allowed. For
this reason the use of ordinary iron bolts (as stove
bolts) or metal fastenings or wire not standardized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
and of known qualities should not be permitted.
The airplane is no stronger than its weakest fitting.
This does not mean that the hardest and strongest
steel must necessarily be used, as ease of working
and freedom from brittleness may be just as important
qualities, but the steel on all metal fittings
should be of high-grade uniform stock. A ductile,
not too easily bent, mild carbon steel is usually
recommended for all steel plate, clips, sockets and
other metal parts. If any parts are required to be
tempered or hardened it must be remembered that
they become brittle and can not afterward be
bent without annealing or softening. Tool or
drill steel is a name given to uniform or rather
reliable grades of steel adapted to heat treatment as
tempering or annealing. Often the bolts, clips,
nuts, pins, devices and other fittings are of special
heat-treated nickel steel which must not be heated
locally for bending or for attachment. Such
work seriously weakens the steel. The steel is
often copper-or nickel-plated and enamelled to
prevent rusting. Do not forget that the proper
material may be twice as strong as other material
which looks the same but which has not received
special treatment.</p>

<p><b>Wires.</b>—Only the highest grade of steel wire,
strand and cord is allowable. Manufacturers,
as Roebling of Trenton, N. J., manufacture special
aviator wire and cord, which is given the highest
possible combination of strength and toughness,
combined with ability to withstand bending, etc.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
Steel wire ropes for airplane work are divided into
three classes as follows:</p>

<p>1. <em>The solid wire</em> = 1 wire (as piano-wire grade)
and known as aviation wire.</p>

<p>2. <em>The strand stay</em>, consisting either of 7 or 19
wires stranded together and known as “aviator
strand.” Flying and landing wires on Curtiss.</p>

<p>3. <em>Cord or Rope Stay.</em>—Seven strands twisted
together forming a rope, each strand being of 7 or
19 wires and known to trade as aviator cord. The
wires are either tinned or galvanized as protection
against rust, etc. Ordinarily galvanizing is used, but
hard wires and very small wires are injured by the
heat of galvanizing and they are therefore tinned.</p>

<p>No. 1. The single wire is the strongest for its
weight. Single wires will not coil easily without
kinking and are easily injured by a blow, therefore
their use is confined to the protected parts of the
machine such as brace wires in the fuselage and in
the wings.</p>

<p>The strand stay (No. 2) of 7 or 19 wires is generally
used for tension wires, as it is more elastic (can
be bent around smaller curve) without injury, as
the flying and landing wires on the Curtiss. The
smaller strands usually have 7 wires, the larger
ones 19 wires.</p>

<p>No. 3. <em>The Tinned Aviator Cord.</em>—The 7 by 19
cord is used for stays on foreign machines. It is
1¾ times as elastic as a solid wire of the same
material. On the Curtiss it is used for control
wires. For steering gear and controls extra flexible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
aviator cord is also recommended. This has a
cotton center which gives extra flexibility and is
used for steering gear and controls. It is 2¼ times
as elastic as a single wire.</p>

<p>Although wire strands or cords are not quite as
strong for the same size as a single wire they are
preferred for general work, being easier to handle
and because a single weak spot in one wire does not
seriously injure the whole strand.</p>

<p>Especial care is necessary to avoid using common
steel wires, or strands which have a frayed or broken
wire, or wire that has been kinked and then
straightened or wire that has been locally heated
or wire that has been bruised. All these factors
weaken steel rope much more than is supposed
ordinarily.</p>

<p><b>Wire Fastening or Terminal Connections.</b>—Wire
terminals are of four classes:</p>

<p>1. <em>Ferrule and dip in solder</em>, then bend back the end.
With or without thimble; used on single wires or on
strand; 50 to 94 per cent. as strong as the wire.</p>

<p>2. <em>Thimble and End Splicing.</em>—The splice must
be long and complete. Used on cable; 80 to 85 per
cent. as strong as the strand; breaks at last tuck in
the splice.</p>

<p>3. <em>Socket.</em>—Nearly 100 per cent. strong.</p>

<p>4. <em>End Wrap and Solder.</em>—Simple and serviceable;
not used for hard wire.</p>

<p>Present practice is rather toward elimination of
acid and solder, imperfect bends, flattening of cable
on bends, and toward care in avoiding all injury as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
kinking to wire, strand and cord due to unskillful
handling of material in the field.</p>

<p><b>Other Metals.</b>—Other metals as aluminum, brass,
bronze, copper, monel metal (copper and nickel)
are used for certain airplane fittings for the reasons
of lightness, non-corrosive qualities, or ease of
bending, etc. The trouble with these metals is
that they are not uniform and reliable in strength
and in an important part the great strength
combined with minimum weight given by steel
is not equalled by any of these metals. Aluminum
is used on the engine hood and also for control levers
and for the backs of the seats. In other words, for
parts and castings which require light metal construction,
but which are under no particular stress.
Tin and copper are used for ferrules of wire joints
and for tankage. Copper or brass wire are used
for safety wires. Special Tobin bronze is used for
turnbuckles as the part must not only be strong but
free from any tendency to rust. Monel metal
(nickel 60 per cent., copper 35 per cent., iron 5
per cent.) is strong and has the special property of
being acid- and rust-resisting. It has been used
for metal fittings and even for wires and for the
water jacket of the motor. Until more strength
tests show greater uniformity of strength, it is
to be recommended with caution.</p>

<p>In dealing with metals like steel, it should be remembered
that they are subject to crystallization
and fatigue.</p>

<p>Repeated jarring may cause a bar of steel to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
break easily at a particular point, when the metal is
said to have crystallized there.</p>

<p>Fatigue of a metal may be defined as loss of
springiness which may come from repeated bending
and which lessens the strength of metal. Above
all, however, corrosion of steel must be guarded
against.</p>

<p>The above points should be clear, as in airplane
work you are dealing with a structure which is
safe with perfect materials and workmanship.
The factor of safety, however, is not great enough
to permit carelessness, or defective material.</p>

<p><em>Linen.</em>—The almost universal wing covering is
fine, unbleached Irish linen, stretched rather loosely
on the wing frames and then treated with dope.</p>

<p>The linen used weighs 3¾ to 4¾ oz. per square
yard, and should have a strength with the length of
the cloth or “warp” of at least 60 lb. per inch of
width. The strength in this direction is slightly
greater than that taken crosswise of the cloth or on
the filler or weft. There is a gain of strength and
tautness by varnishing or “doping.”</p>

<p>In general, it is desirable to have wing material
which will not sag easily and have the fabric yield
rather than break. This often reduces stress and
saves complete failure.</p>

<p><em>Dope.</em>—The linen must be coated with a more
or less waterproof dope. Some form of cellulose
acetate or nitrate with more or less softening material
is used and to these some suitable solvent as
acetone is added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>The cellulose acetate or nitrate in the dope acts
as a waterproof sizing, shrinks the cloth tight, and
prevents it from changing in tightness due to
moisture. Spar varnish protects this layer from
peeling and makes the wing more waterproof. In
service, varnish or dope must be applied every
few weeks.</p>

<p>The U. S. Army practice calls for four coats of
cellulose nitrate dope followed by two coats of spar
varnish to prevent inflammability. Cellulose nitrate
is more elastic and durable than the acetate
but is also more inflammable.</p>

<p>Commercial dopes with various desirable properties
are: Cellon, Novavia, Emaillite, Cavaro,
Titanine, etc.</p>

<span class="bold">ERECTING AIRPLANES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Airplanes shipped from the manufacturer or from
another field almost always suffer more or less from
shipment or packing. Care must be exercised in
unpacking in order not to do any more damage.
Boxes should be placed with the part marked
“Top” uppermost. Cables and wires must be
handled carefully in order not to bend or twist
them. Every bent or kinked wire or damaged
turnbuckle must be replaced, or at least brought to
the attention of an inspector.</p>

<p>The order of erection is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Assemble landing gear to fuselage and align
landing gear before putting on main panels.</p>

<p>2. Assemble tail.</p>

<p>3. Assemble engine section and align before attaching
main panels.</p>

<p>4. Assemble main panels.</p>

<p>1. <b>Landing Gear Assembly to Fuselage.</b>—The
landing gear is assembled by mounting the wheels
on the axle, and bolting wheels in place. The
fuselage should now be elevated to receive the landing
gear. This may be accomplished in one of two
ways—either by tackle or by shims and blocking.
For either method, first connect up the tail skid.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
This is accomplished by pinning up the front end
of the skid to the spring-fitting, and then pinning
in the other end to the tail-post socket.</p>

<p>If block and tackle are used to raise the fuselage,
pass a line under the engine-bed supports or sills
just to the rear of the radiator. To this line attach
hook of block. <b>To avoid damaging or crushing
some part do not attach lifting device to any other
point.</b> With the fuselage now resting on its attached
tail skid, lift the front end until the lower
longeron clips clear the landing gear. When the
clips on the longerons line up with the clips on the
ends of the struts of the landing gear the bolts are
passed down through the holes thus aligned. This
places the nuts <em>on the down side</em> of the connection
thus facilitating assemblies and inspection of connections.
The castellated nuts are then put on
the bolts and drawn up tight, until the drilled hole
in the bolt is visible through the castle of the nut.
Then insert cotter-pin and spread the two leaves
backward over the nut. This locks the nut in
place. When the landing gear has been completely
assembled to the fuselage, the tail of the machine
should be elevated and supported by a horse and
blocking until the upper longeron is level. This
can be determined by placing a spirit level on the
upper longeron at the tail or on the two engine-bed
sills in machines where these sills are parallel to the
top longeron, as in Curtiss JN-4B.</p>

<p>2. <b>Horizontal Stabilizer.</b>—After the upper longeron
is levelled up, the horizontal stabilizer is assembled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
to the tail of the fuselage. The horizontal
stabilizer is fastened by means of bolts in the top
longeron and the tail post. The nuts are all drawn
up tight and cotter-pinned. The vertical stabilizer
is next erected in place.</p>

<p><b>3. Vertical Stabilizer.</b>—The vertical stabilizer is
now fastened to the horizontal stabilizer, first by
means of the bolt which passes up through the forward
part of the horizontal stabilizer and then by
means of the flexible stay lines running from the
top of the vertical stabilizer. The forward bolt
passes through the clip at the lower front point of
the vertical stabilizer. Draw the nuts up tight
and lock with cotter-pins. Flexible wire cables are
attached to vertical stabilizer, and turnbuckles are
used to align and tighten cables. The vertical
stabilizer is further aided in its alignment by the
bolt clip at its toe and by the double clip at its heel.
This rear double clip passes over the two bolts which
are attached to the tail post and which hold down
the horizontal stabilizer.</p>

<p><b>4. Rudder.</b>—The control braces are first attached
to the rudder. These braces are so placed
that the upper tips point toward the hinge line. In
this fashion the holes will match up. The rudder is
mounted on the tail post and vertical stabilizer by
means of the hinges. The hinge pins are inserted
in the hinges, and cotter-pins passed through the
drilled holes in the bottom of the pins. The cotter-pins
should be spread backward as usual.</p>

<p><b>5. Elevators or Flaps.</b>—These are first equipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
with the control braces which are also arranged so
that the upper tips point toward the hinge line.
The elevators are mounted to the horizontal stabilizer
by means of the hinges and hinge pins. The
hinge pins are kept in their bearings by the cotter-pins,
inserted through the drilled holes in the bottom
of the hinge pins.</p>

<p><b>6. Panel Assembly.</b>—The panels are now to be
assembled. Before the main panels can be connected
to the fuselage, the engine section panel
must be erected.</p>

<p><em>Engine Section Panel.</em>—The engine section struts
are first set into place in their sockets on the engine
section. Then the whole thing is lifted up to place
and the four struts are set into their sockets on the
upper longeron. The bracing wires are attached
and the engine section aligned by means of them
(see alignment).</p>

<p><b>7. Main Panels.</b>—The main panels are now to be
assembled to the machine. There are two methods
for accomplishing this: first, assemble panels, struts
and wires, before attaching to fuselage; second,
assemble the upper plane to the engine section, and
complete assembly. The first method is the most
advantageous, since it permits the setting of the
main panels at the correct stagger and dihedral, and
does not require as much adjustment as the second
method, which will be omitted.</p>

<p><b>Assembling Panels Together Before Fastening
Them to Fuselage.</b>—All the main struts will be
found to bear a number. These numbers run from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
1 to 8, on Curtiss JN-4. The numbers on the
Standard run from 1 to 12 including the center section
struts. The method used in numbering the
posts is as follows: Starting at post No. 1, with the
outer post, on the left-hand side of the pilot, as he
faces his direction of travel, the posts are numbered
successively from No. 1 to No. 4; Nos. 1 and 2 being
on the left side and Nos. 3 and 4 being on the right
side. The rear posts are similarly numbered from
No. 5 to No. 8, Nos. 5 and 6 being on the left and
Nos. 7 and 8 being on the right. This system of
numbering does not include the engine section
struts. The plan shows the system graphically
(see Fig. <a href="#fig_39">39</a>).</p>

<p>The system of marking also insures that the struts
are not inverted in their sockets. This is accomplished
by painting the number on the strut, so
that when viewed from the pilot’s seat, all numbers
can be read, <em>i.e.</em>, the numbers are painted on that
side of the strut intended to face the fuselage. If
a strut is inverted by mistake, it can thus be quickly
detected. The procedure of assembling panels is as
follows:</p>

<p>1. The upper left-wing panel is first equipped
with mast, by inserting the mast into its socket on
the upper surface of the wing. The mast wire is
then connected up to the clips to the right and left
of the mast. Adjust the tension in this wire, by
means of turnbuckles, until the spar becomes
straight.</p>

<p>2. Stand the upper left-wing panel and lower left-wing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
panel on their “leading” or “entering”
edges, properly supporting the panels in cushioned
blocks to prevent damage to the nose. Space the
panels apart, at a distance approximately equal to
the length of the struts.</p>

<p>3. Next connect up the diagonal cross wires.
These must be loosely connected up, to permit the
easy entering of the posts into the sockets. The
wires are connected before the posts or struts are set
in place, since with the latter in place, the connecting
of the wires to the lugs of the sockets is accomplished
only with difficulty. After these wires are
thus connected, insert the posts and bolts into place.</p>

<p>4. Connect up closely the “landing” (single)
wires, and “flying” (double) wires of the outer bay
to hold the wings together as a unit. The outer bay
is thus completely wired, though but loosely.</p>

<p>5. The posts that are used for this left side are,
according to the diagram, No. 1, No. 2, No. 5, No. 6.
No. 1 is the outer front; No. 2 is the inner front;
No. 5 is the outer rear; No. 6 the inner rear.</p>

<p>6. The wings, as above assembled, are now
erected to the fuselage. Extreme care should be
exercised in transferring the wings to the fuselage,
not to strain or break them. In carrying the wings,
use wooden boards placed under the wings, and
block up under the wing beams (which can be
easily located), so that these take the strain of the
load. Do not attempt handling assembled wings,
using the posts as carriers; or by attachments to the
trailing or leading edges. The wings should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
suitably supported temporarily by suitable sling at
the outer upper post point (not beyond this point)
or by a horse, properly blocked under lower wing at
outer lower post point (not beyond this point)
during fitting of wing to machine. The wings will
have the approximate stagger if assembled as
above, since the posts are in place, and the tension
cross wires are adjusted to almost correct length
when shipped. Insert the hinge pins through the
hinges as now coupled up, lower hinges first.</p>

<p>The machine is now ready for alignment, perhaps
the most important of the rigger’s duties.</p>

<p><b>Alignment of Airplanes.</b>—The proper alignment
of a machine largely determines the flying qualities
of that machine.</p>

<p>The alignment of the fuselage should be done at
the factory or in the repair shop. However, the
alignment of the whole machine depends upon the
correctness of the fuselage. Directions for aligning
and checking fuselage are, therefore, given.</p>

<p>The order in which the different parts of a machine
should be aligned is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">
<p class="no-indent">
<span style="padding-left: .5em">1.</span> Alignment of landing gear.<br>

10. Length of struts, positions and fittings, warp in planes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span><br>
11. Alignment of ailerons.<br>
12. Alignment of stabilizer.<br>
13. Alignment of elevator flaps.<br>
14. Alignment of rudder.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The tail of the machine should be raised until
the fuselage is nearly horizontal before starting the
alignment.</p>

<p><b>1. Alignment of Landing Gear.</b>—When a machine
is being assembled, it is easier to align the landing
gear before the wings are put on.</p>

<p>Take the weight off the landing gear by supporting
the fuselage on sawhorses.</p>

<p>The axle should be parallel with the lateral axis
of the machine.</p>

<p>The center of the axle should be directly under
the center of the fuselage. This can be secured by
either of two methods:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>By Measuring Cross Distances.</em>—Loosen and
tighten the cross wires until the cross distances are
exactly the same. Take all measurements from
similar points on the fittings to which the wires are
attached.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>With Level and Plumb Bob.</em>—Level the fuselage
crosswise. Mark the exact center of the fuselage
and drop a plumb bob. Mark the exact center
of the axle. Adjust the cross wires until the plumb
bob is over the center of the axle. Tighten the
wires until fairly tight, and safety them.</p>

<p><b>2. Alignment of the Center Section.</b>—When assembling
a machine, the center section should be
aligned before the wings are put on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>When a machine is already assembled, the first
thing to do is to loosen all wires except the landing
wires. This is very important, for if one wire is
tightened against another wire, an unnecessary and
possibly a dangerous strain may be put upon some
member. The bracing wires connecting tops of
center section struts should be tight enough to hold
the shape of the center section when bracing wires
are tightened up.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_38" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig_38.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span>—Center section and undercarriage alignment.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>Machines Having No Stagger.</em>—In machines
having no stagger, the struts of the center section
should be perpendicular to the propeller axis. As
the upper longerons are usually parallel to the propeller
axis, they may be used as a base line.</p>

<p>Align one side of the center section first, then the
other side, and lastly the front.</p>

<p>From a point at the lower end of one of the front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
center section struts (the center of a bolt head for
example), measure forward on the longeron a certain
distance. From the same point (center of bolt head)
measure back on the longeron exactly the same
distance.</p>

<p>Move the upper end of the strut forward or backward
by loosening one of the bracing wires and
tightening the other, until the distance from the
two points on the longerons to some point on the
center line at the top of the strut (center of bolt
head) are exactly the same. The strut will then
be perpendicular to the propeller axis. Tighten
both wires evenly until fairly tight. Measure the
cross distances (the diagonal distances between
similar points at the upper and lower ends of the
front and rear struts), and align the other side of
the center section until its cross distances are the
same as those on the opposite side.</p>

<p>Align the front of the center section by loosening
one cross wire and tightening the other, until one
cross distance is exactly the same as the other cross
distance.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Machines Having Stagger.</em>—In machines
having stagger, the shape and position of the
center section strut fittings usually determines the
amount of stagger the machine was designed to have
(Fig. <a href="#fig_38">38</a>-<em>a</em>). The JN-4 has 10⅝-in. stagger, <em>i.e.</em>,
a plumb line dropped from the leading edge of
upper panel should be 10⅝-in. from leading edge
of lower panel.</p>

<p>Adjust the wires on one side of the center section<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
until the struts and that side are in their correct
positions as shown by the shape of the fittings.
Tighten the wires, measure the cross distances, and
adjust the wires on the other side of the center section
until the cross distances are exactly similar
to the first set.</p>

<p>A more accurate method is to drop a plumb line
from the leading edge of the center section and adjust
until the line is at the correct distance ahead
of the point on the fuselage where the leading edge
of the lower wing meets it. This point may be determined
by measuring the distance from the inside
of the front hinge to the leading edge of the lower
wing and then laying off this distance on the body
from the front of the hinge on the lower longeron.
Better still, if the hinges are at the same distance
from the leading edge on both top and bottom wings,
the plumb line may be dropped from the front side
of the hinge on the center section and the stagger
measured back to the hinge on the lower longeron
(Fig. <a href="#fig_38">38</a>-<em>b</em>). This has the advantage of setting the
plumb line out far enough to clear the fuselage.
Also the measurements are easily made.</p>

<p>Next, adjust the two front wires until one cross
distance is exactly the same as the other cross distance
(Fig. <a href="#fig_38">38</a>-<em>c</em>).</p>

<p><b>3. Alignment of Leading Edge.</b>—(<em>a</em>) <em>Upper
Plane.</em>—The leading edges of the upper and lower
planes of one wing should next be made perfectly
straight. By standing on a step ladder, placed 15
to 20 ft. to one side, and sighting along the leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
edge of the upper plane, any bow or warp can be
easily seen. This should be straightened out by
loosening or tightening the front landing wires.
The edge should be brought in exact line with the
leading edge of the center section.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Lower Plane.</em>—After the leading edge of the
upper plane has been made straight, sight along the
leading edge of the lower plane. If there is no warp
in the plane, this edge should also be straight.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) <em>Align the opposite wing in the same manner.</em></p>

<p><b>4. Getting Both Wings the Same Height.</b>—Place
a small tack exactly in the middle of the leading
edge of the center panel.</p>

<p>Measure from this tack to similar points at the
lower ends of the intermediate and outer struts
(Fig. <a href="#fig_39">39</a>). Make these distances the same on each
side by raising or lowering one wing or the other,
or by raising one wing and lowering the other wing,
all the while keeping the leading edges of both wings
perfectly straight.</p>

<p><b>5. Dihedral.</b>—The method of setting the wings
of a machine at a dihedral angle is as follows:</p>

<p>Place two tacks in the leading edge of the upper
plane, one tack near the tip of each wing and exactly
the same distance out from the tack in the center
section. Stretch a string tightly between the two
outer tacks, until there is no sag in the string.</p>

<p>A dihedral angle of 178° means that each wing has
been raised 1°. To set the wings of a machine at a
dihedral angle of 178° for example:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Find the natural sine of 1° (0.0175).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Multiply this by the distance in inches between
the center tack and one of the outer tacks.
The result will give the rise, in inches, of the string
over the tack in the center section.</p>

<p>Raise the wings equally, keeping the leading edges
perfectly straight, until the proper rise shows over
the center section.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig_39" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig_39.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">Fig. 39.</span>—Alignment diagrams.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><b>6. Alignment of Trailing Edge (Angle of Incidence).</b>—(<em>a</em>)
<em>Lower Plane.</em>—The trailing edge should
be brought parallel to the leading edge. This can
be done by bringing the rear spar in line with the
leading edge.</p>

<p>Stand squarely in front of the center of the machine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
15 to 20 ft. away. Sight under the leading
edge of the lower plane; move forward or backward
until the fittings under the rear spar are just visible.
Raise or lower the trailing edge by loosening or
tightening the rear landing wires, until all of the
fittings on the rear spar appear equally under the
leading edge.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Upper Plane.</em>—After aligning the trailing
edge of the lower plane, place a ladder in front of the
center of the machine, and sight under the leading
edge of the upper plane. If there is no warp in this
plane, the trailing edge should align with the leading
edge.</p>

<p>The objection to this method is that since there
are no fittings next the body on the rear spar, there
is room for considerable error in the angle of incidence.</p>

<p>Reversing the process and finding the angle of
incidence at each set of struts secures the alignment
of the trailing edge and removes the liability to
error. To set wings at correct angle of incidence
proceed as follows (Fig. <a href="#fig_39">39</a>): Place the airplane
in rigging position, <em>i.e.</em>, level up the top longeron or
engine bearers. Set the corner of the straight-edge
against the center of the rear spar, level up the
straight-edge, and measure from the top of the
straight-edge to the center of the front spar or to the
lowest point of the leading edge. This must be
done next the body and under each set of struts.
(It is useless to make such a measurement between
the struts because of possible warping of the wings.)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
Unless the wings have a washout or washin the
measurements must agree, thus making the angle
of incidence the same all along the wing. Then
the trailing edge must necessarily be parallel to the
leading edge.</p>

<p><b>7. Stagger.</b>—The stagger should be the same all
along the wing as it is for the center section. With
the machine in rigging position drop a plumb line
from the leading edge of the upper wing in front of
each set of struts. The distance from the plumb
line to the lower edge should equal the stagger. If
there is too much, tighten the diagonal wire running
from the lower rear socket to the upper front socket,
being sure that the other diagonal wire is loosened
somewhat. For too little stagger tighten the latter
and loosen the former wire.</p>

<p>Check up the dihedral and alignment of the trailing
edges to see if these have been disturbed while
setting the stagger. If not, the droop may be put
in.</p>

<p><b>8. Droop.</b>—To correct for the torque of the propeller,
one wing of a machine is slightly drooped.</p>

<p>In single-motored tractor types, if the propeller
turns to the right, when looking from the rear, the
left wing is drooped, and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p>The outer rear landing wire of the wing to be
drooped should be loosened until the trailing edge,
between the outer and intermediate struts, appears
to be about an inch (for machines of not more than
100 hp.) lower than the rest of the trailing edge.
The practice with the Curtiss JN-4B is to loosen the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
inner rear landing wire on the left wing ¼ in. and
loosen the outer rear landing wire ½ in. after the
angle of incidence and stagger have been adjusted
so that corresponding wires on the right and left
wings are the same length.</p>

<p><b>9. Tightening and Safetying All Wires.</b>—(<em>a</em>)
After the wing is drooped, all flying wires should
be tightened to the same tension, and just taut
enough to take out all sag.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Next tighten all drift or cross wires between
the front and rear struts to the same tension.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Drift wires from the wings to the fuselage, and
from the wings to the landing gear, if any, should
be tightened last.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Safety all turnbuckles. A wire too loose will
vibrate when the machine is in the air.</p>

<p>The flying and drift wires should be so tightened
that when they take the weight of the machine
in the air, there will be no sag in the landing
wires.</p>

<p><b>10. Length of Struts, Positions of Fittings, Warp
in Planes.</b>—The above instructions are given for
machines that are true, that is, machines having
no bends, warps, or bows in the spars and leading
or trailing edges.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Similar struts should be of the same length.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Similar fittings occupying similar positions
should be spaced the same. If difficulties are
encountered in getting the measurements to tally,
check up the lengths of the struts and the positions
of the fittings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) If the planes of a machine are warped, the
machine should be so aligned that the warp is
equally divided between both planes.</p>

<p><b>11. Alignment of Ailerons.</b>—Before aligning ailerons,
place the shoulder yoke or wheel controlling
the ailerons in the center of its path of movement.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>Trailing-edge Ailerons.</em>—Trailing-edge ailerons
should be set ¾ inch lower than the trailing edge of
the plane to which they are attached.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Interplane Ailerons.</em>—Interplane ailerons
should be set so that they are both in the same
plane, when in neutral position.</p>

<p>In machines having interplane ailerons, nose
heaviness and tail heaviness may be corrected by
setting the trailing edges of the ailerons up or down.</p>

<p>The proper amount to raise or lower the trailing
edges can be determined only by experimenting
with each particular type of machine.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) The control wires should be just tight enough
to eliminate any lost motion.</p>

<p><b>12. Alignment of Stabilizer.</b>—Support the weight
of the tail on the tail skid.</p>

<p>The rear edge of the stabilizer should be perfectly
straight, and should be parallel with lateral axis of
the machine.</p>

<p>Stand behind the center of the stabilizer, and
align its rear edge on the leading edge of the
upper plane by sighting. Tighten wires and safety
turnbuckles.</p>

<p><b>13. Alignment of Elevator Flaps.</b>—Set the elevator
control in its mid-position. Adjust the elevator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
control wires until the flaps are in their
neutral position and both are in the same plane.
The wires should be just tight enough to eliminate
any lost motion. Safety turnbuckles.</p>

<p><b>14. Alignment of Rudder.</b>—Set the rudder control
(wheel, foot pedals, or foot bar) in its mid-position.
Adjust the rudder control wires until the
rudder is in its neutral position. The control wires
should be just tight enough to eliminate any lost
motion. Safety the turnbuckles.</p>

<p><b>15. General.</b>—All connections having been made,
carefully go over each shackle, pin, and turnbuckle,
and see that all pins are properly in place, all
nuts on bolts tight and all cotter-pinned. Try out
all controls for action and freedom of movement.
See that no brace wires are slack, yet not so taut
that when plucked they “sing.”</p>

<p><b>16. Overall Adjustments.</b>—As a final check, the
following overall measurements should be taken
(see Fig. <a href="#fig_39">39</a>).</p>

<p>The straight lines <em>AC</em> and <em>BC</em> should be equal
to within ⅛ in. The point <em>C</em> is the center of the
propeller, or in the case of the pusher the center of
the nacelle. <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are points on the main spar
and must be at the same distance from the butt of
the spar. They must not be merely the sockets of
the outer struts as these may not be accurately
placed. <em>AC</em> and <em>BC</em> must be taken from both top
and bottom spars; two measurements on each side
of the airplane.</p>

<p>Similarly <em>FD</em> and <em>FE</em> should be equal to within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
⅛ in. <em>F</em> is the center of the fuselage or rudder
post. <em>D</em> and <em>E</em> are points marked on both top and
bottom rear spars just as <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> were marked on
front spars.</p>

<p>If these measurements are not correct, it is probably
due to some of the drift or antidrift wires being
too tight or too slack. These must then be located
and corrected.</p>


<h3>WING COVERING AND PATCHING</h3>

<p>The wings are covered with best quality Irish
linen which must have a tensile strength of at least
50 lb. per inch width, undoped, and 70 lb. when
doped.</p>

<p>The linen strips are sewed together on a sewing
machine in such a way that when folded together
they form a sort of bag which just slips over the
wing frame. The seams then run diagonally across
the wing. The bag is stretched up loosely and
tacked temporarily along the leading edge. The
edges are folded under a little and sewed together
along the leading edge of the wing and the temporary
tacks are removed. To hold the covering
up to the ribs, thread is looped through from one
side of the panel to the other around the ribs.
The rough surfaces made by the thread along the
ribs and the edges are covered over with strips of
linen pasted on with dope. To make a smooth
job, the edges of these strips are frayed out ⅛ in.</p>

<p>Three or more coats of dope are applied and
rubbed down after each coating is dry. This is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
then covered over with one or two coats of varnish
to make it more weatherproof and smooth. Varnish
also prevents the dope from peeling off.</p>

<p>Dope shrinks the linen and makes it fit up tight
to the framework.</p>

<p>Breaks in the fabric are patched by first removing
the dope around the break with dope remover
and then sticking on a patch with dope. This is
applied with a rag instead of a brush in order to
prevent the patch from becoming white. Ten to
sixteen coats of dope are then applied over the
patch, each coat being allowed to dry before the
next is applied.</p>

<h3>FAULTS IN FLIGHT, DUE TO IMPROPER ALIGNMENT
AND HOW TO CORRECT THEM</h3>

<p>An airplane pilot may experience difficulty with
the flying qualities of his machine. Consequently
he should know something about the conditions
which are responsible for the various kinds of unsatisfactory
flying qualities which are more or less
characteristic of airplanes.</p>

<p>In the chapter on “Principles of Flight” the
reader has been made acquainted with such terms
as stability, instability, longitudinal stability, etc.
For the purposes of rigging, however, it will be well
to review these terms again.</p>

<p><em>Stability</em> is a condition whereby an object disturbed
has a natural tendency to return to its
first and normal position. Example: a weight suspended
by a cord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p><em>Instability</em> is a condition whereby an object disturbed
has a natural tendency to move as far as
possible away from its first position, with no tendency
to return. Example: a stick balanced vertically
on your finger.</p>

<p><em>Neutral stability</em> is a condition whereby an
object disturbed has no tendency to move farther
than displaced by the force of the disturbance,
and no tendency to return to its first position.</p>

<p>Now in order that an airplane may be reasonably
controllable, it is necessary for it to possess some
degree of stability longitudinally, laterally and
indirectionally.</p>

<p><em>Longitudinal stability</em> is its stability about an
axis transverse to the direction of normal horizontal
flight, and without which it would pitch and
toss.</p>

<p><em>Lateral stability</em> is its stability about its longitudinal
axis, and without which it would roll sideways.</p>

<p><em>Directional stability</em> is its stability about its vertical
axis, and without which it would have no tendency
to keep its course.</p>

<p>Whenever an airplane does not fly properly,
aside from conditions arising from engine or propeller
trouble, either its longitudinal, lateral, or
directional stability is affected. When its longitudinal
stability is affected we call this condition
longitudinal instability; likewise, regarding lateral
stability and directional stability, referring to these
conditions respectively as lateral and as directional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
instability. The effect of alignment errors will be
treated under the foregoing respective heads.</p>


<p><b>Alignment Errors, Longitudinal.</b>—</p>

<p>1. <em>The Stagger May Be Wrong.</em>—The top surface
or wing may have drifted back a little owing
to some of the wires, probably the incidence wires,
having elongated their loops or having pulled the
fittings into the wood. If the top surface is not
staggered forward to the correct amount, then consequently
the whole of its lift is too far back, and
it will then have a tendency to lift up the tail of
the machine too much. The airplane will then be
said to be nose-heavy. A ¼-in. error in the stagger
will make a very considerable difference in the
longitudinal stability.</p>

<p>2. <em>The Angle at Which the Main Surfaces Are
Set Relative to the Fuselage May Be Wrong.</em>—This
will have a bad effect especially in the case of an
airplane with a lifting tail plane or horizontal stabilizer.
If the angle of incidence is too great, the
machine will have a tendency to fly “tail-high.”
If the angle is too small the airplane may have a
tendency to fly “tail-down.”</p>

<p>3. <em>The Fuselage May Have Become Warped
Upward or Downward.</em>—This would give the tail
plane or horizontal stabilizer an incorrect angle of
incidence. If it has too much angle, it will lift too
much, and the airplane will be “nose-heavy.” If
it has too little angle, it will not lift enough and
the airplane will be “tail-heavy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>4. <em>The Tail Plane May Be Mounted upon the
Fuselage at a Wrong Angle of Incidence.</em>—If this
condition exists, it must be corrected by making a
change at the fittings. If nose-heavy, the tail
plane should be given a smaller angle of incidence.
If tail-heavy, it should be given a greater angle of
incidence; but care should be taken not to give it
too great an angle, because the longitudinal stability
entirely depends upon the tail plane being
set at a smaller angle of incidence than is the main
surface, and if that difference is decreased too much,
the airplane will become uncontrollable longitudinally.
Sometimes the tail plane is mounted on the
airplane at the same angle as the main surface,
but it actually engages the air at a lesser angle,
owing to the air being deflected downward by the
main surfaces.</p>

<p><b>Alignment Errors, Lateral.</b>—The machine manifests
a tendency to fly one wing down. The reason
for such a condition is a difference in the lifts of
the right and left wings, assuming the motor torque
is already taken care of by washout. That may
be caused as follows:</p>

<p>1. <em>The Angle of Incidence of One Wing May Be
Wrong.</em>—If it is too great, it will produce more
lift than on the other side of the airplane; and if
too small, it will produce less lift than on the other
side—with the result, in either case, the airplane
will try to fly one wing down.</p>

<p>2. <em>Distorted Surfaces.</em>—If some part of the surface
is distorted, the lift will not be the same on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
both sides of the airplane, which, of course, will
again cause it to fly one wing down.</p>

<p>3. <em>The Ailerons May Be Set Slightly Wrong.</em>—This
may be due to one control cable being longer
than the other, or one of the aileron horns being
bent or twisted. This condition can easily be detected
by setting the aileron control—in neutral
and checking up the position of the ailerons.</p>

<p><b>Alignment Errors, Directional.</b>—If there is more
resistance on one side of the airplane than on the
other the airplane will, of course, tend to turn
to the side having the most resistance. This may
be caused by the following conditions:</p>

<p>1. <em>The Angle of Incidence of the Right and Left
Surfaces May Be Unequal.</em>—The greater the angle of
incidence, the greater the resistance. The less the
angle, the less the resistance.</p>

<p>2. <em>If the Alignment of the Fuselage, Vertical
Stabilizer, the Struts or Stream-line Wires Is Not
Absolutely Correct.</em>—That is to say, if they are
turned a little to the right or left instead of being
in line with the direction of flight—then they will
act as a rudder and cause the airplane to turn off
its course.</p>

<p>3. <em>If Any Part of the Surface Is Disturbed It
Will Cause the Airplane to Turn off Its Course.</em>—If,
owing to the leading edge, spars, or trailing
edge becoming bent, curvature is spoiled, that will
result in changing the amount of resistance on one
side of the airplane, which will then develop a
tendency to turn off its course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p><b>Additional Flight Defects.</b>—In addition to the
foregoing the following conditions may also exist
which cause trouble when flying as well as when
landing:</p>

<p><em>Airplane Climbs Badly.</em>—Such a condition, apart
from engine or propeller trouble, is probably due to
excess resistance somewhere.</p>

<p><em>Flight Speed Poor.</em>—This condition apart from
engine or propeller trouble, is probably due to
(1) distorted surfaces, (2) wrong angle of incidence,
or (3) dirt or mud, resulting in excessive skin friction
and weight.</p>

<p><em>Inefficient Control.</em>—This is probably due to (1)
wrong setting of the control surfaces, (2) distortion
of control surfaces, or (3) control cables being badly
tensioned.</p>

<p><em>Will Not Taxi Straight.</em>—If the airplane is uncontrollable
on the ground it is probably due to (1)
alignment of the undercarriage being wrong, (2)
unequal tension of shock absorbers, (3) tires unequally
inflated, (4) axle bent, (5) tight wheel and
axle, (6) loose spokes causing wheel to wobble.</p>

<span class="bold">TRUING UP THE FUSELAGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Before an airplane is assembled for the first time
after leaving the factory, and especially after it has
made its first few “breaking-in” flights, the fuselage
or basic framework should be carefully examined
and checked up. This is done in order to
determine whether or not the fuselage became distorted
from rough usage during shipment (which is
always likely) or from taking sets due to the flying
stresses to which it was subjected for the first time
during the “breaking-in” flights. It frequently
happens that rough landings and “stunt” flying
cause distortions of the fuselage frame and other
parts of the airplane so that it is very necessary
to make a careful inspection immediately after to
ascertain not only what twists, bows and stretching
of vital parts have resulted, but also to detect fittings,
wires, etc., which may have been pulled loose
or broken. The extreme importance of having your
airplane adjusted correctly and carefully, and to
know that it is in the proper condition can not be
reiterated too often. And, since the fuselage is
the foundation from which, so to speak, the entire
apparatus is built up, it is doubly important that
it should always be in correct adjustment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>When the fuselage is built in the factory it is
placed on a long table whose surface is perfectly
horizontal and which has metal strips inlaid. This
table in reality is a big face plate especially arranged,
as described, for fuselage truing in the factory.
The fuselage, of course, has had none of its coverings
applied when it is placed on the table, nor are
the accessories such as controls and engine in place.
On this table then the builders begin to do the necessary
adjusting and this is no simple or quick job.
Working from a perfectly smooth horizontal surface
it is, of course, easy to detect warpings, twists, etc.,
of the framework. These are first remedied by
tightening or loosening of cross wires, etc., as the
case may be. Then, when the fuselage is reasonably
square and level, lengthwise and crosswise,
as determined by the eye, check measurements are
taken by rule, trams and level and final adjustments
made to bring the various parts in final proper relation
to one another. For instance, the rudder post
must be perfectly vertical, as determined by a
plumb line, when the engine bearers or the top
longerons are level. The various fittings such as
those for horizontal and vertical stabilizers and the
engine sections and side panels must all conform
accurately to one another so that the airplane as a
whole, when it is assembled, will not contain any
inherent defects such as tail planes with slightly
distorted angles of incidence, left main panels ahead
of right or over or under right main panels, fittings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
so located that an initial strain must be imposed
upon them by forcing them together, etc.</p>

<p>After the fuselage has been lined up in the factory
as described briefly above, it is permitted to set
for a week or so and then it is checked up again and
such additional slight corrections made which would
be necessitated by the sets which had occurred.
The additional fittings required are then applied
and the fuselage finally covered and sent away to
have the engine and instruments applied.</p>

<p>When checking and truing a fuselage on the
flying field after the airplane has been assembled
and flown the process is not quite so simple as when
the fuselage is checked up and trued in the factory,
largely owing to the lack of ideal factory facilities
and also because so many fittings, coverings,
etc., are in the way which one must always be
cautious about removing. In general, the method
of procedure may be outlined as follows, but it
must be obvious that one can not in a series of written
notes touch upon all the possible queries and
combinations of fuselage distortions which may
occur and the ways for detecting and correcting
them. A certain amount of experience in the field
accompanied with some fixed habits of inspection,
and everlasting curiosity about the perfections of
your machine, and a willingness and readiness always
to pitch in and help correct the defects found,
will soon develop in you the ability to diagnose
easily and quickly and remedy intelligently whatever
trouble you may run across.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>For satisfactory fuselage checking and truing let
us say in the field shop, a certain minimum equipment
of tools is necessary. This equipment is:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>At least two sawhorses about 3 to 4 ft. high for mounting
the fuselage in flying position.</p>

<p>Several wooden wedges (show taper) for easy adjustment of
fuselage for cross and lengthwise level.</p>

<p>About 25 yd. of strong linen line for checking center lines.</p>

<p>2 carpenter levels about 2 to 3 ft. long.</p>

<p>4 perfectly formed steel cubes about 1¼ to 1½ in. in size.</p>

<p>1 plumb bob.</p>

<p>1 small screw jack.</p>

<p>1 pair of wood clamps.</p>

<p>1 straight edge about 12 ft. long.</p>

<p>Several small Crescent adjustable wrenches.</p>

<p>Several pliers with wire-cutting attachment.</p>

<p>Pins for manipulating turnbuckles.</p>

<p>1 steel tape.</p>

<p>1 foot rule, 6 ft. long.</p>

<p>1 small brass hammer.</p>

<p>A small work bench equipped with a 3-in. or 4-in. vise.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>The fuselage which is to be trued is mounted on
the horse with the wedges between the top horse
rails and the lower longerons. These horses or
trestles should be so arranged that about three-fourths
of the fuselage toward the tail sticks out
unsupported. In this way it will take, as near as
possible, its normal flying position. It is always
desirable, in fact quite necessary, especially when
checking a fuselage for the first time, to have the
airplane’s specifications as well as a detailed drawing
of the fuselage and an assembly of the airplane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
as a whole available. The reason for this, of course,
is quite obvious.</p>

<p>The engine bearers and the top longerons are the
basic parts from which the fuselage as a whole is
lined up. Consequently the first thing which is
done, when inspecting the fuselage for alignment,
is to test the truth of these parts. This is done by
sighting the top longerons lengthwise to see if they
are bowed downward, upward, inward or outward.
As near as possible the fuselage is made level on
the trestles. The steel blocks or cubes referred to
in the tool list above are placed on the longerons
and the straight edge and level placed on these,
first crosswise and then lengthwise. A string is
stretched over the top of the fuselage touching the
top cross braces and brought as close as possible to
the center of these pieces. This string should
stretch from the rudder post as far forward as possible.
Then the cross wires or diagonal brace wires
are sighted to see how close their intersections agree
with this center-line string. Furthermore, the level
is placed on the engine bearers and they are tested
for cross level and longitudinal level. If the engine
is mounted in place, but one point on the bearers will
be available for this purpose, but the check should
nevertheless be made. It may also be found that
the longitudinal level of the engine bearers can be
tested from underneath by placing the steel cubes
mentioned above on the top of the level and then
holding the level up against the bottom of the
bearers. As a rule, if the fuselage is warped it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
should be possible to detect this with the eye, but
when engine bearers are out of line this can only
be detected with certainty by the use of the level.</p>

<p>Let it be assumed that the fuselage is out of true.
The first parts to tackle are, of course, the engine
bearers. If they should not be in line they must
first be brought so, and afterward kept in this condition.
The diagonal wires at the front of the fuselage
should be adjusted to make this correction. If
the bearers are badly out of line it will, perhaps, be
wisest to remove the engine, or at least loosen it
up from the bearers before doing any adjusting for
the reason that it may become strained by serious
pulling on the bearers. After the bearers are in
place, it will be safe to bolt the engine fast again.</p>

<p>With the engine bearers temporarily disposed of,
the fuselage proper is tackled. Here the first thing
to do is to get the top surfaces of the longerons level
crosswise. Use the spirit level and the two steel
cubes mentioned in the tool list for this purpose.
Start at the front of the fuselage in the cock pit.
Adjust the internal diagonal wires until the level
bubble is in its proper place. Then measure these
first two sets of diagonal wires, getting them of
equal length. Continue this process throughout the
length of the fuselage until the rear end is reached,
always working from the front.</p>

<p>Lastly, before proceeding to the next operation, try
the engine bearers for level again. If out, make the
proper adjustments.</p>

<p>If the centers of the crosswise struts are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
marked, this should first be done before going
further. Then stretch a string from No. 1 strut,
or as far forward as possible to the center of the
rudder post. All center points on the cross struts,
if the fuselage is true lengthwise, should lie exactly
on this string. If not, adjust the horizontal
diagonal wires, top and bottom, working from the
front, until the center-line points all agree. Always
check by measuring diagonal wires which are mates.
These should be of equal length. If not, some wire
in the series may be overstressed. In order to pull
the center points on the cross struts over, always
stop to analyze the situation carefully, determining
which are the long diagonals and which the short
ones from the way the fuselage is bowed. Then
shorten the long ones and ease off on the short ones,
being careful never to overstress any of the wires.</p>

<p>The last thing to do is to bring the longerons or
the center line of the fuselage into level lengthwise.
For this purpose a long straight-edge, the two cubes,
and a spirit level are of advantage, although simply
stretching a string closely over the top of the
longeron may suffice. Then as in the case of removing
a crosswise bow in the fuselage, here too,
we manipulate the outside up and down diagonal
wires in bringing the top longerons into their proper
level position lengthwise, always working from the
front.</p>

<p>After all this is done it is well to make some overall
checks with steel tape or trams to see how various
fittings located according to the drawings, agree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
with one another. Since there is a right and a
left side, distance between fittings on these sides
may be compared. And, finally, the engine bearers
should be tried again. In short no opportunity
should be neglected to prove the truth of the fuselage
as a whole and in detail.</p>

<p>It might be pointed out that an excellent time
to check the fuselage is when engine is being removed
or changed. In fact this time in general is a
good one to give the airplane as a whole, a careful
inspection.</p>

<p>After all the necessary corrections have been
made and all the parts of the fuselage brought into
correct relation with one another, the turnbuckles
are safety wired and then served with tape to act
as a final protection. The linen covering is reapplied
if it had previously to be removed and the
level, empennage wires, panels etc., are placed in
position and aligned as pointed out in the notes on
assembly and alignment.</p>

<span class="bold">HANDLING OF AIRPLANES IN THE FIELD
AND AT THE BASES PREVIOUS
TO AND AFTER FLIGHTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>No unimportant part of the operation and maintenance
of airplanes is their handling in the field,
and at the various bases previous to, between,
and after flights. This phase of the entire subject
contemplates the transportation of airplanes in
knockdown condition either by railway or truck,
their unloading and unpacking, to a certain extent
their assembly, their storage in hangars and sheds,
their storage and disposition in the open, their disassembling
and packing for transportation, etc.</p>

<p><b>The Unloading and Unpacking of Airplanes.</b>—The
personnel required to unload an airplane properly
boxed and crated from a railway car, is 15
men and two non-commissioned officers. The
tools needed for this purpose are:</p>
<br>

<table class="autotable fs90">

<br>

<p class="no-indent">A regular flat-bed moving truck or ordinary truck
with a flat-bed trailer should be provided for handling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
the machine from the car to the field erecting
shop.</p>

<p>Airplanes are usually shipped in automobile cars
with end doors or gondola cars. After opening
doors of cars, examine and inspect all crates and
boxes carefully to see that they are all there in
accordance with the bill of loading or shipping
memorandum, as well as to see that they are
in good condition. If any boxes are found
damaged, they should not be removed from the
car without first reporting the fact to the receiving
officer.</p>

<p>Next, all cleats and bracing should be removed.
The crate containing the fuselage and engine should,
if possible, be unloaded first. The heavy end where
the engine is fixed should be lifted up, have 2-in.
pipe rollers put underneath and manipulated into
the truck which has been backed up against the
car door so that this heavy end, when finally placed,
will rest on the body of the truck as far forward as
possible. Next lash the front end of the box
securely to the truck.</p>

<p>Should it happen that the fuselage crate is so
located in the car that the light end must of
necessity emerge first through the door, then this
end may be run on to a truck and the crate removed
from the car with the heavy end adequately supported
by sufficient help. Another truck is then
backed up against the rear of the first one which
has been moved into the clear, and the heavy end
of the fuselage crate brought to rest as far forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
as possible in the second truck. It is then secured
and the first truck released.</p>

<p>After the box is properly lashed by means of the
manila rope, a man should be placed on each side
of it to watch and see that the lashings do not loosen
and the box shift in transit. Trucks should be
driven slowly, especially over rough ground, tracks,
etc. In addition to the fuselage crate it may also
be possible to load the panel crates on this same
truck, but as a rule it is better to load these on a
second truck. Common sense goes a long way in
transporting aircrafts by motor trucks.</p>

<p>Unloading of the crates is done with the use of
skids applied to the rear of the truck and secured so
as to form a sort of an inclined plane down which to
slide the boxes on the pipe rollers to the ground.
These skids should be at least 4 in. by 4 in. by 6 ft.
and made of strong wood. The rear end of the
crate may be brought to the ground, rested there,
and the truck moved forward slowly until the entire
length rests on the ground. Care must be used not
to jolt or drop this box at any stage whatsoever.</p>

<p>When uncrating the fuselage, remove the top and
both ends of the box. Fold both sides of box flat
down on ground and use same for assembling
machine. The wing boxes should have the tops
removed and planes lifted out in that manner.</p>

<p>Next, the airplane is assembled in accordance
with instructions already given.</p>

<p><b>The Dismantling and Loading of Airplanes.</b>—When
airplanes are to be prepared for shipment by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
motor truck or railway, they should, of course, be
taken down and crated similar to the way they
were shipped from the factory. The order in which
this is done should be as follows:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>Remove propeller.</p>

<p>Unfasten control wires.</p>

<p>Unfasten main planes from fuselage and dismantle on ground.</p>

<p>Remove tail surfaces.</p>

<p>Unless machine is to be placed in box, landing gear and tail
skid should remain attached to fuselage.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>If the machine is crated it should be handled
when shipped the same as described above. If,
however, it is to be loaded without being crated,
then the following procedure should be observed.
Using two planks, 2 in. by 12 in. by 18 ft. long for
runway from ground into car, load machine into
car, engine first. Block wheels to prevent machine
shifting. Secure fuselage, tail end, to the floor of
the car by means of ropes passed over the fuselage
and fastened to the floor with cleats. The wings
should be crated against the sides of car and secured
by wires, ropes or canvas strips. All boxes should
be marked with name of organization, destination,
weight, cubic contents, hoisting centers, number of
box, “This Side Up,” etc. A shipping memorandum
should always be made out and mailed to
destination when shipment goes forth.</p>

<p><b>Storing of Airplanes and Parts at Bases and in
Fields.</b>—Airplanes when not in active flying duty
are stored in hangars or sheds especially adapted
to house them. Under certain conditions it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
necessary to store them in the open. In each case
particular precautions should be observed in order
not to subject the machines to unnecessary wear
and tear.</p>

<p>Since moisture is one of the airplanes’ worst
enemies in that it deteriorates the weatherproofing
and the fabric, distorts and otherwise injures the
wooden parts of the machines and worst of all,
rusts the metal parts, the first consideration for
proper storage facilities should be the absence of
moisture. Next, extreme heat and cold are a
menace to airplanes. The temperature of the air
surrounding them while in storage should be regulated
as much as possible. Under shelter, especially
when the machine is to be out of active service for
48 hr. or more, the entire machine should be raised
off the ground a few inches so that the wheels are
free and the flexible connections released. This is
done by the points where the undercarriage struts
meet the skids. Furthermore, the wings might
well be supported and the weight thus taken off
the landing wires, and hinge connections by placing
padded trestles underneath the wing skids. Care
should be exercised that dirt, grease, water, etc.,
does not accumulate in any part of the airplane.</p>

<p>Furthermore, all water should be drained from
the radiator and gasoline from the gasoline tank.
The propeller should be placed in a vertical position
and covered with a weatherproof cloth. The
engine cockpit and instruments should all be covered
and the magneto should be enclosed in a thick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
layer of felt or cotton waste. If any fluid is apt
to freeze, and oil will freeze in temperatures low
enough, it should be carefully drained.</p>

<p>When spare parts such as wings, struts, fuselages,
etc., are stored, the same general precautions outlined
above should be observed. Spare planes
particularly should be placed in such a manner
that their weight is evenly supported. Never
should planes of any kind be laid flat on the ground.
They should always stand edgewise, with the leading
edge down, supported several inches off the
ground on blocks or boards evenly spaced. One
plane must not be allowed to lean against another.
In fact, the best way is to suspend planes by means
of canvas slings hung from overhead. Within the
loop of the slings there must be a batten about
2½ in. wide.</p>

<p>All parts of an airplane subject to attack by rust
should be kept well coated with grease or oil.
Periodically the entire machine should be wiped
by means of clean, dry cheese cloth or selected
cotton waste. Engines which are in stored planes
or which have been set aside for future use should
be turned over by hand daily.</p>

<p>It will sometimes be impossible for airplane sheds
or hangars to be brought up to the front on service,
hence, airplanes must be prepared to remain in the
open. When this is the case they should be placed
to the leeward of the highest hedge available, a
clump of trees, a building, a bank, a knoll, or hill,
etc. They should be sunk as low as possible by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
digging a trench for the wheels and undercarriage.
The nose of the plane should, of course, first be
run into the wind, and then the wings and the tail
pegged down with ropes, particularly if there is
any chance of a wind starting up. The engine,
propeller, instruments, and cockpit should be covered
over with a waterproof cloth and great care
taken to protect the propeller from the sun, for it will
surely warp if not cared for properly. At night
in cold or wet weather the magneto should be packed
round with waste and water in the radiator drained.
While machines are stored in the open, the necessity
of wiping them to keep them moisture and dirt
free is all the more urgent and should be pursued
with doubled energy.</p>

<span class="bold">INSPECTION OF AIRPLANES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mechanics in charge of airplanes, who are primarily
responsible for their safety while in their care,
should constantly think of new methods for insuring
greater safety and reliability. They should invariably
bring any fresh points they think of to
the attention of their Flight Commander, in order
that the rest of the Corps may benefit by them.
They should always try to find out the <em>cause</em> of
anything wrong, and inform the officer in charge
of the machine of their opinion. They should bear
in mind any particular incidents which may have
happened to their machine while under their charge
during each flight, and be on the lookout for signs
of stresses that may have occurred to the machine
in consequence of these incidents. For example, a
steep spiral may cause side strains on the engine
bearers; a flight in bad weather may cause bending
stresses on the longitudinal members of the body,
besides stretching the landing and flying wires.
No part of a machine can be safely overlooked, and
good mechanics will always be seeking for the possible
cause of accidents and bringing them to the
notice of the officer in charge of the machines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>During all inspections the following matters of
detail deserve particular attention:</p>

<p>Look out for dirt, dust, rust, mud, oil on fabric.
Cleanliness is the very first consideration.</p>

<p>Give the control cables particular attention.
These should not be too tight, otherwise they will
rub stiffly in the guides. The hand should be passed
over them to detect kinks and broken strands.
They should be especially well examined where
they run over pulley. Don’t forget the aileron
balance wire on the top plane.</p>

<p>See that all wires are well greased and oiled, and
that they are all in the same tension. When
examining wires, be sure to have machine on level
ground as otherwise it may get twisted, throwing
some wires into undue tension and slackening
others. The best way, if time is available, is to
jack the airplane up into “flying position.” If a
slack wire is found, do not jump to the conclusion
that it must be tensioned. Perhaps its opposite
wire is too tight, in which case it should be slackened.</p>

<p>Carefully examine all wires and their connections
near the propeller, and be sure that they are snaked
around with safety wire, so that the latter may keep
them out of the way of the propeller if they come
adrift.</p>

<p>Carefully examine all surfaces, including the controlling
surfaces, to see whether any distortions have
occurred. If distortions can be corrected by adjustment
of wires, well and good, but if not, matter
should be reported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>Verify the angles of incidence, the dihedral angle,
the stagger, and the overall measurements as often
as possible (at least once a week) and correct as
outlined in notes on assembly and adjustment of
airplanes.</p>

<p>Constantly examine the alignment and fittings of
the undercarriage, the condition of tires, shock
absorbers and the skids. Verify the rigging position
of the ailerons and elevators.</p>

<p>Constantly inspect the locking arrangements of
the turnbuckles, bolts, etc.</p>

<p>Learn to become an expert at vetting, which
means the ability to judge the alignment of the
airplane and its parts by eye. Whenever you have
the opportunity practice sighting one strut against
another to see that they are parallel. Standing
in front of the machine, which in such a case should
be on level ground, sight the center section plane
against the tail plane and see that the latter is in
line. Sight the leading edge against the main spars,
the rear spars, and the trailing edges, taking into
consideration the “washin” and “washout.” You
will be able to see the shadow of the spars through
the fabric. By practising this sort of thing you
will, after a time, become quite expert, and will be
able to diagnose by eye faults in efficiency, stability
and control.</p>

<p>The following order should be observed in the
daily and weekly inspections:</p>

<p><b>Daily Inspection.</b>—All struts and their sockets,
longerons, skids, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>All outside wires and their attachments.</p>

<p>All control levers or wheels, control wires and cable
and their attachments.</p>

<p>All splices for any signs of their drawing.</p>

<p>Lift and landing gear cables or wires for any signs
of stretching.</p>

<p>All fabrics, whether on wings or other parts of the
machine, for holes, cuts, weak or badly doped
places, or signs of being soaked with gasoline, and
to see if properly fastened to wings, etc.</p>

<p>All outside turnbuckles, to see that they have
sufficient threads engaged, and that they are
properly locked.</p>

<p>Axles, wheels, shock absorbers, and tires, pumping
the latter up to the correct pressure.</p>

<p>The seats, both for passenger and pilot, seeing
that they are fastened correctly.</p>

<p>Safety belts and their fastenings.</p>

<p>This examination should be carried out systematically
in the following order:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Lower wings, landing gear complete, tail
planes with all wires attached to these tail skids
and all attachments and rudder.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Nacelle or fuselage, bolts of lower plane, all
control levers and wires.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Top wings, wing flaps or ailerons and wires.</p>

<p><em>Inspection after Each Flight.</em>—The landing gear,
tail skid and attachments and lift and drag wires for
tautness.</p>

<p>The wheels, after a rough landing, for bent spokes,
uncovering them if necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>After flying is finished for the day, wipe all oil off the
planes as far as possible with a cloth or cotton waste.</p>

<p><em>Weekly Inspection.</em>—Check over all dimensions,
span, chord, gap, stagger of wings, angles of incidence
or set angle of wings and tail, dihedral angle,
alignment of fuselage, rudder, elevators, and the
general truth of the machine.</p>

<p>Examine the points of crossing of all wires to see
that there are no signs of wear, and that each wire
is properly bound with insulating tape to prevent
rubbing.</p>

<p>Examine all places where wires cross the strut
to see if the plates require renewal.</p>

<p>Examine any control wires which are bound together,
and see that they are correct. (Insulating
tape should be used for this in preference to wires
which are bound to slip and cause slack.)</p>

<p>Examine the wheels for bent or loose spokes, uncovering
if necessary.</p>

<p>Examine all nuts and bolts of cotter-pin applications,
lock washers, etc.</p>

<p>The following directions for inspection are given
to the U. S. Inspectors of Airplanes:</p>


<p class="no-indent"><em>Inspection of Cables.</em></p>

<p>Are there any kinks in the cable?</p>

<p>Are loops properly made?</p>

<p>Are thimbles used in eyes?</p>

<p>Are ends wrapped properly (when wrapped splice
is used, wrap must be at least fifteen times the diameter
of wire).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>No splicing of the cable itself is permitted.</p>

<p>Has acid struck cable during soldering?</p>

<p>Are any of the strands broken?</p>

<p>Are unwrapped ends stream-lined and show the
result of skilled workmanship?</p>


<p class="no-indent"><em>For Roebling Hard Wire.</em></p>

<p>Are there any file cuts or flaws to weaken it?</p>

<p>Is loop well made?</p>

<p>Is ferrule put on correctly?</p>

<p>Are there any sharp bends or kinks?</p>

<p>Are wires too loose or tight in machine?</p>


<p class="no-indent"><em>Fittings.</em></p>

<p>Is workmanship good?</p>

<p>Is material good?</p>

<p>Are holes drilled correctly to develop proper
strength?</p>

<p>Are there any deep file cuts or flaws to weaken it?</p>

<p>Is rivet or fastening wire put in properly?</p>

<p>Are thimbles of large enough diameter?</p>


<p class="no-indent"><em>Turnbuckles.</em></p>

<p>Any file cuts, tool marks, or flaws in shank or
barrel?</p>

<p>Are there too many threads exposed?</p>

<p>Is turnbuckle of right strength and size to develop
full strength of wire?</p>

<p>Are shanks bent?</p>

<p>Are threads on shank or in barrel well made?</p>

<p>Is barrel cracked?</p>

<p>Is turnbuckle properly wired?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>


<p class="no-indent"><em>Inspection of Linen.</em></p>

<p>All linen used in airplane construction should be
of the following specifications:</p>

<p>Free from all knots or kinks.</p>

<p>Without sizing or filling.</p>

<p>As near white as possible.</p>

<p>Weight, between 3.5 and 4.5 oz. per square yard.</p>

<p>Strength as per Government Specifications.</p>


<p class="no-indent"><em>Inspection of Wood.</em></p>

<p>All wood should be inspected before varnish is
applied.</p>

<p>Is grain satisfactory?</p>

<p>Are there any sap or worm holes?</p>

<p>Are there any knots that look as if they would
weaken the member?</p>

<p>Any brashiness?</p>

<p>Any holes drilled for bolts or screws that would
weaken the member?</p>

<p>Any splits or checks?</p>

<p>Are laminations glued properly?</p>

<p>Are there any plugged holes?</p>

<p>Any signs of dry rot?</p>


<p class="no-indent"><em>Inspection of Metal Fittings.</em></p>

<p>When fittings are copper plated and japanned the
inspection should take place after the copper
plating.</p>

<p>Have fittings been bent in assembling?</p>

<p>Does fitting show any defects that lessen its
strength?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>Are holes drilled properly. Do fittings fit?</p>

<p>Sheet aluminum should be inspected for defects
such as cracks, bad dents, etc. Where openings
occur in sheet aluminum the corners should be
rounded, allowing a good-sized radius.</p>


<p class="no-indent"><em>Directions for Work.</em></p>

<p>Before you start work on rigging you are advised
as follows:</p>

<p>1. Do not hurry about the work. No rush jobs
can be done in airplane rigging.</p>

<p>2. You are cautioned against leaving tools of any
kind in any part of the airplane.</p>

<p>3. The bolts and their threads must not be burred
in any way; for this reason, the use of pliers or pipe
wrenches on bolts is very bad form.</p>

<p>4. Start all turnbuckles from both ends every
time they are connected up.</p>

<p>5. Full threads must be had in every case to
develop the full strength of a bolt and nut, with
turnbuckles at least turn on for a distance equal to
three times the thickness of the shank.</p>

<p>6. Lock with safety wires all turnbuckles and pins,
and cotter-pin every nut.</p>

<p>7. Watch for kinking of wires and their rubbing
around controls and wherever they may vibrate
against one another.</p>

<p>8. All bolts and pins must have an easy tapping
fit only; do not pound them into position.</p>
